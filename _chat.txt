2/18/13, 10:46:30 PM: Neil Gysel: Ask around Kim.. Don't take my word on it.
2/18/13, 10:51:13 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Did you guys know that each time apple speaks to me, there is no friendly precursor as a 'hi', but straight in to 'can your company sponsor us', to which I typically say, 'sponsor who'? Followed by a 'no, sorry'. This is a repeating conversation.
2/18/13, 10:54:02 PM: Neil Gysel: :)
2/18/13, 10:55:01 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Just wait till you see the sponsorship packages we have planned if we win.

2/18/13, 11:14:53 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: You don't have to vote online
2/18/13, 11:14:56 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: You can vote at the agm

2/19/13, 9:31:47 PM: Neil Gysel: And I don't believe the first step should be sending out an open mass email.
2/19/13, 9:32:03 PM: Neil Gysel: (Sorry lincoln I know ur about to gag from all the frisbee talk)
2/19/13, 9:32:14 PM: Kim Alexanderson: I've voted Neil!
2/19/13, 9:32:22 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Done online
2/19/13, 9:32:30 PM: Kristin Franke: I personally love frisbee talk from far far away
2/19/13, 9:32:32 PM: Kim Alexanderson: As I leave for langkawi tmr..
2/19/13, 9:34:51 PM: Sam Axelrod: I can't vote as I'm not a member
2/19/13, 9:34:58 PM: Sam Axelrod: So I won't vote
2/19/13, 9:35:34 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Become a member
2/19/13, 9:36:04 PM: Sam Axelrod: Apparently it's too late to pay and vote
2/19/13, 9:36:44 PM: Sam Axelrod: Some kinda bullshit the board did
2/19/13, 9:37:02 PM: Sam Axelrod: Which makes me not really wanna vote for any of them
2/19/13, 9:37:24 PM: Kim Alexanderson: BULL!
2/19/13, 9:41:58 PM: CAL: You know a gossip is someone
2/19/13, 9:42:02 PM: Tommy Fung: i love how she bypassed terry by sending it out with her personal email
2/19/13, 9:42:10 PM: CAL: with a great sense of rumor
2/19/13, 10:21:55 PM: Neil Gysel: Sam, we're working on the voting rights.
2/19/13, 10:22:10 PM: Neil Gysel: I know it sucks for people who missed the cut off.
2/19/13, 10:22:19 PM: Neil Gysel: Just give us a minute to talk through it.
2/19/13, 10:30:05 PM: CAL: Maybe an age limit for voting rights?
2/19/13, 10:30:22 PM: CAL: I'm worried apple will buy the election via the mysterious u23 team
2/19/13, 10:45:35 PM: Neil Gysel: 2012 paid members may have a chance if they pay for 2013 at the AGM.
2/19/13, 10:46:04 PM: Neil Gysel: The board is discussing it right now.. Everyone is stressed out - of course not I because I'm like a calm white obama.
2/19/13, 10:46:49 PM: Neil Gysel: Just give the board some time..
2/19/13, 10:47:19 PM: Sam Axelrod: I can't make the meeting anyways
2/19/13, 11:00:42 PM: Lincoln Cheung: Theres always reason for the bullshit Sam. The board is trying to find the fairest way to conduct things
2/19/13, 11:01:58 PM: Sam Axelrod: My issue is that this wasn't communicated to anyone but the hkupa board
2/19/13, 11:02:21 PM: Sam Axelrod: Who we all voted in to represent us
2/19/13, 11:02:38 PM: Sam Axelrod: And part of representing is communicating to your constituents
2/19/13, 11:02:52 PM: Lincoln Cheung: It's not easy and the people involved (not me) are spending long hours to try fix things
2/19/13, 11:03:05 PM: Sam Axelrod: I know man
2/19/13, 11:03:15 PM: Lincoln Cheung: Please be patient and they are taking feedback and come up with the best solution possible
2/19/13, 11:03:30 PM: Lincoln Cheung: It was communicated but not well
2/19/13, 11:03:54 PM: Sam Axelrod: I appreciate everyone's work. It's just when you feel wronged its irritating.
2/19/13, 11:04:05 PM: Sam Axelrod: But I'm sure it will work out
2/19/13, 11:04:07 PM: Lincoln Cheung: Agreed
2/19/13, 11:04:21 PM: Sam Axelrod: Now back to watching kittens on the Internet
2/19/13, 11:05:19 PM: Lincoln Cheung: I feel wronged in my pants
2/19/13, 11:06:07 PM: Kim Alexanderson: You should see a doc about that...

2/21/13, 10:21:06 PM: Lincoln Cheung: Candy crushing ...
2/21/13, 10:21:43 PM: Jak Lau: I bet Jess helps you crush those candies good
2/21/13, 10:21:45 PM: Sam Axelrod: Spanking monkeys
2/21/13, 10:21:48 PM: Jak Lau: Eugh
2/21/13, 10:23:09 PM: CAL: I don't want to spoil the ending but Lincoln tries to resign from Vice-President

2/21/13, 10:40:26 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: But Cat said the lights were swinging at home, which adheres to the scientific method, as far as I'm concerned.
2/21/13, 10:42:00 PM: Neil Gysel: Maybe its just the general public excitement for the AGM causing a stir?
2/21/13, 10:42:53 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Yeap definitely felt it! :s

8/30/13, 1:52:04 AM: Anton Delcamp: If her student visa is still valid (even just few days) , they may just grant her entry on that visa. Maybe she should specifically ask the officer for a tourist visa to avoid misunderstanding.

9/20/13, 10:40:25 PM: CAL: If you were flying back into Hong Kong at Sunday night 8pm...Would you change to an earlier flight?
9/20/13, 10:42:12 PM: Anton Delcamp: How much earlier?
9/20/13, 10:44:48 PM: Anton Delcamp: Current map puts it on HK around midnight Sunday night. Not quite sure how long before and after flights could be affected.
9/20/13, 10:49:38 PM: CAL: Hmm I could change to a flight getting in at 4 or 6
9/20/13, 10:52:58 PM: Anton Delcamp: Is it an issue if you have to stay abroad because of weather condition? I'm not sure how flights would be affected. Maybe the pilots from hkupa have been briefed. No T1 yet though...
9/20/13, 10:54:51 PM: Luisa Zhou: I departed from Hong Kong on a T8 day
9/20/13, 10:56:10 PM: Luisa Zhou: If I were you I would def get on an earlier flight
9/20/13, 10:57:15 PM: Donna Gee: What peeps up to today!!
9/20/13, 10:57:25 PM: Luisa Zhou: It's more likely your flight will be delayed later than earlier during the day
9/20/13, 10:58:00 PM: Luisa Zhou: What are u up to doons?
9/20/13, 10:58:00 PM: Anton Delcamp: You can probably depart if conditions are ok on site, but at the time of boarding overseas, if conditions in HK are unstable, they may not take the risk of taking off, if they are few hours away.
9/20/13, 11:01:57 PM: Donna Gee: Thinking beach and hammock

9/21/13, 11:08:07 PM: Jessica Yam: Well the 440 flight is full, I would have to standby and pay extra if I can make that. 7pm is my original flight and no announcement yet. Phil air already cancelled all their flights tmr morning too
9/21/13, 11:08:23 PM: Tuan Phan: Well, i had a legitimate excuse for a seven day vacation to Taipei, hit on hot Taiwanese women, and I didn't take it. You could say flying back early is also foolish. Extend and enjoy your breaks! Seize the day guys, don't be like me!!
9/21/13, 11:08:48 PM: Tuan Phan: Carpe diem!

9/21/13, 11:52:05 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Hmm never heard that definition..
9/21/13, 11:52:28 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Is that something you do in front of the mirror every morning..?
9/22/13, 12:02:49 AM: Mike Ying: Anyone already not going to disc?
9/22/13, 12:05:39 AM: Anton Delcamp: Probably not going. Still packing.

9/22/13, 6:21:42 AM: Mike Ying: Zing! Tim o's brand of subtle sarcasm. Your voice is clear.
9/22/13, 6:22:29 AM: Tim Orourke: Did anyone go to disc?

9/22/13, 10:29:22 PM: Charlotte Poon: It's not a full report if you don't get Tuen Mun, still windy, tree debris everywhere. There was way too much hype for this typhoon, not even a T10!
9/22/13, 10:31:51 PM: Sam Axelrod: Well it's not like Sharknado was a good movie
9/22/13, 11:00:15 PM: Jak Lau: The trailer sounded awesome anyway.
9/22/13, 11:20:29 PM: Anton Delcamp: French media report 20 dead in Guangdong though.
9/22/13, 11:41:37 PM: Tim Orourke: So do people need to go to work today as it was still a T8 in the morning?
9/22/13, 11:44:20 PM: Anton Delcamp: You need to go to work within 2 hours after they take down T8. But no work if signal is taken out after 3pm (if I recall correctly).
9/22/13, 11:44:52 PM: Anton Delcamp: Some schools are closed though, since T8 was still in force after 6am.
9/22/13, 11:45:07 PM: Donna Gee: Mine:)
9/22/13, 11:45:20 PM: Anton Delcamp: Nice!
9/22/13, 11:46:14 PM: Anton Delcamp: MTR at 10.30 was like 8.30 on normal days.

9/24/13, 8:18:19 AM: CAL: Hkupa question: why has no one sent out an email about wuhan and hangzhou hat? These tournaments were announced months ago and I've reminded hkupa to issue an email, but I bet most people in this group didnt know they were happening

9/24/13, 8:23:37 AM: Jessica Yam: Hey calster, terry just forwarded your email from last Monday to the board today. Must have slip from his mind??
9/24/13, 8:28:07 AM: Jessica Yam: Also, I think we typically just broadcast outside tournaments via Facebook
9/24/13, 8:29:29 AM: CAL: Ah that's ok, the typhoon might have slowed down email service
9/24/13, 8:30:42 AM: Tim Orourke: Well, Cal, don't leave us in suspense, when are these tournaments?

9/24/13, 8:32:55 AM: CAL: Hangzhou is the "Halloween hangover", 2-3/11
9/24/13, 8:33:39 AM: Tommy Fung: I think they can post on the website

10/2/13, 7:54:44 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Wrestling
10/2/13, 7:54:51 AM: Mike Ying: Taxpayers
10/2/13, 7:56:42 AM: CAL: Not sure exactly what you mean, but there's nothing to force congress to agree to a budget. There's essential funding that's guaranteed and still being spent
10/2/13, 7:59:02 AM: Kevin Ho: So theoretically could the republicans refuse to pass the spending bill indefinitely?
10/2/13, 8:07:19 AM: Clay Carol: If nothing is passed in 2 weeks Sam becomes President.

10/2/13, 8:11:48 AM: Kim Alexanderson: No budget forever! Senate vs house hunger games fight (one with health insurance and the other with nothing)
10/2/13, 8:12:28 AM: Mike Ying: If nothing is passed in 2 weeks congress will be replaced with an equally retarded concept like temporary interns.
10/2/13, 8:15:40 AM: Mike Ying: If nothing is passed in two weeks you can call a stall out.
10/2/13, 8:16:16 AM: Mike Ying: If nothing is passed in two weeks why is time standing still?!?!??!
10/2/13, 8:20:27 AM: Neil Gysel: can we go back to hash tag jokes?

10/23/13, 11:47:55 PM: Tim Orourke: A punnet is a small container for the gathering and sale of fruit and vegetables, typically small berries. The word is largely confined to Commonwealth countries
10/23/13, 11:50:38 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: -wikipedia

10/24/13, 12:23:28 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: I know right? Sheesh..
10/24/13, 12:23:58 AM: Conor Quigley: Now I wonder what other words I use that are strange?
10/24/13, 12:24:27 AM: Mike Ying: When was the last time you used the word.punnet?!?!?!?

10/24/13, 12:27:14 AM: CAL: Wait sorry, that's just the straw part
10/24/13, 12:27:20 AM: Mike Ying: I'm pretty sure nectarines peaches and plums don't come in punnets in Hong Kong either. Is there. Special name for those fruit boxes /trays with the open.top?
10/24/13, 12:27:27 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Hay hay, Cal's back

10/24/13, 4:59:51 AM: Tuan Phan: Now I can say I've played on a team with a national champion to my kids and they'll be so proud of me. Congratulations Kristin!

10/28/13, 9:40:46 AM: Mike Ying: How about pumpkin lasagna?
10/29/13, 1:03:09 AM: Nick Tsao: Debate: why is pumpkin pie called a pie when it has no top crust?
10/29/13, 1:04:10 AM: Jak Lau: Because pie sounds better than "pumpkin thing with no top crust"
10/29/13, 1:04:28 AM: Mike Ying: Is that instead of a tart?
10/29/13, 1:04:44 AM: Nick Tsao: Yeaa. It doesnt even have a cream cover
10/29/13, 1:05:52 AM: Julia Yung: I thought pies just have pie crusts but not necessarily a crust top. E.g keylime pies
10/29/13, 1:21:39 AM: Mike Ying: This is more of a pop quiz right? You have the answer no? Pies are light, tarts are heavy, I'm gonna say it has something to do with the filling and not the pastry.
10/29/13, 1:22:54 AM: Julia Yung: Thought tarts are individual-sized pies?
10/29/13, 1:35:17 AM: Clay Carol: Mike, Julia, is this really about pies/tarts?
10/29/13, 1:57:16 AM: Jessica Yam: Nick Tsao are you attempting a pumpkin pie?!?! üòç

10/29/13, 2:04:48 AM: Lincoln Cheung: Bd
10/29/13, 3:18:12 AM: Conor Quigley: Tarts can e any size and are generally sweet. The word derives from the French Tarte. 
Pie's generally have a top crust hence the expression 'the upper crust' referring to the best part.
10/29/13, 3:24:41 AM: Mike Ying: Nick can.you please tell us why a pumpkin pie is so even though it has no upper crust so I can think about finding you a date
10/29/13, 5:23:12 AM: CAL: What do you get when you divide the circumference of a pumpkin by its diameter?
10/29/13, 5:25:52 AM: Lincoln Cheung: Big dick nick ?

11/13/13, 9:38:36 AM: Nick Tsao: It makes as much sense to outsiders as 'hat tournament' (not much sense)
11/13/13, 9:48:30 AM: Neil Gysel: how would the full thing read nick?
11/13/13, 9:49:30 AM: Nick Tsao: 2014È¶ôÊ∏ØÈ£õÁõ§Á∏ΩÊúÉÂ∏ΩÂ≠êÈå¶Ê®ôË≥Ω

11/13/13, 10:54:50 PM: Donna Gee: Yeah they want medicine food and water right... But I'm guessing they won't say no to clothes???
11/13/13, 10:56:59 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Yeah it might hinder the distribution process.. I've heard that before too
11/13/13, 10:57:25 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Because the non essentials bog down the sorting the volunteers do
11/13/13, 10:59:55 PM: Tim Orourke: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2013/11/how_to_help_typhoon_haiyan_survivors_in_the_philippines_the_only_donation.html
11/13/13, 11:02:39 PM: Tim Orourke: It's tough, some people, including PUA asked for clothes, etc. but some articles say don't. As far as I know, if you bring anything to Manila, it will first get sorted there by volunteers then what is needed will shipped later to the affected areas
11/13/13, 11:05:15 PM: Mike Ying: And please do due diligence when sending money.
11/13/13, 11:16:22 PM: Sam Axelrod: Not enough carbs
11/13/13, 11:27:39 PM: Charlotte Poon: It helps a lot that we are bringing it to the Philippines and not shipping
11/13/13, 11:31:40 PM: Charlotte Poon: I think the clothes and things that come after food, water and medicine will be in the mid to long term relief delivery
11/13/13, 11:32:20 PM: Charlotte Poon: Echo mikey and happy to vouch for ICM's diligence haha üòÑüòÑ
11/13/13, 11:33:19 PM: Charlotte Poon: Love how we're all connected to the Philippines somehow, and Raquel is excited to see those of us going to Spirits
11/13/13, 11:33:52 PM: Tim Orourke: Gotta love ultimate!
11/13/13, 11:35:05 PM: Kristin Franke: You guys rock. Way to go spirits setting up ways to help also.
11/14/13, 12:24:06 AM: Charlotte Poon: Anyone flying 730 pm tmr?

11/14/13, 9:55:15 PM: Tim Orourke: This one
11/14/13, 9:56:50 PM: Mike Ying: Dunno. Most recent message says sorry we know a lot of ppl registered so we had to randomly deny some ppl or something. üò©
11/14/13, 9:59:27 PM: Jana Evans: I wouldn't worry yet Yinger. They said the wait list was short and a ton of people usually drop out
11/14/13, 9:59:55 PM: Tim Orourke: Oh, that sucks. But they say people are on the waiting list and they expect many people to drop out. Email Tri and ask if you are on the waiting list. Have you been to the BKK hat before? If not, give a compelling reason why you want to go
11/14/13, 10:00:34 PM: Tim Orourke: Jana is right, last couple years some people showed up at the reg party and got in

1/22/14, 6:10:35 AM: Mike Ying: As both a partying frisbee player and an eager filipino I resent either side being labelled in such a context as being 'sketch'! Just giving you a hard time, one progressive to another üòã
1/22/14, 7:06:13 AM: Tuan Phan: Poor use of language and phrase from me, sincere apologies mike. I certainly don't mean to label helpers as sketch, but just the operations of a Sunday afternoon in wc, with a lot of very blunt socioeconomic and race implications and assumptions. Hmmm though now I think I just come across as a racist ass, humble apologies.
1/22/14, 7:08:10 AM: Neil Gysel: I'm putting Tuan on my limited profile.
1/22/14, 7:12:02 AM: Lincoln Cheung: Get back on your boat tuan

1/22/14, 7:13:11 AM: Neil Gysel: help spread the word!!
1/22/14, 7:13:16 AM: Mike Ying: üòã sorry tuan I saw an opportunity! Who knows, one night in wanchai, you turn around and BOOM. you sketch. üòÇ
1/22/14, 7:13:48 AM: Mike Ying: I just worry about the people who think it but don't say it.
1/22/14, 7:14:10 AM: Mike Ying: And by think it, I mean actually think that way.
1/22/14, 7:15:30 AM: Mike Ying: Reminds me of a joke my banker uncle recanted from his colleagues about the latest STD sweeping through wc.

1/23/14, 9:58:06 PM: Neil Gysel: it was just scary - I would have like to see the build up to that point.
1/23/14, 9:58:16 PM: Mike Ying: Was her vagina trying to escape to freedom?

1/23/14, 9:59:57 PM: Tim Orourke: Sure it wasn't a Tenga Egg?

1/28/14, 8:11:21 PM: Luisa Zhou: People that have HSBC account, have you heard about the news? I was getting cash last night and I was only allowed to withdraw 1000
1/28/14, 8:12:32 PM: Jak Lau: Did the ATM run out of cash?
1/28/14, 8:13:08 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Eh??
1/28/14, 8:14:54 PM: Donna Gee: ???
1/28/14, 8:15:46 PM: Neil Gysel: they set a limit?
1/28/14, 8:15:46 PM: Neil Gysel: Luisa,  what are you doing taking out more then 1k on a Tuesday night!!!
1/28/14, 8:16:25 PM: Donna Gee: Hahahha. 1000 doesn't even cut it for a night out on a Tuesday
1/28/14, 8:18:45 PM: Neil Gysel: Is Gio still out of town?
1/28/14, 8:18:45 PM: Neil Gysel: Luisa is making it raiiiiinn
1/28/14, 8:20:10 PM: Luisa Zhou: Yeaaaah
1/28/14, 8:21:37 PM: Luisa Zhou: I just read some articles this morning and got worried. I think last night was just probably because the machine was running out of cash. But the news is saying HSBC might be on the verge of collapse... Not sure how realistic it is tho
1/28/14, 8:22:28 PM: Luisa Zhou: http://therealsingapore.com/content/hsbc-bank-verge-collapse-second-major-banking-crash-imminent
1/28/14, 8:22:31 PM: Mike Ying: Yeah Singapore times has an article about it.
1/28/14, 8:22:52 PM: Mike Ying: Yeah that one nvm.
1/28/14, 8:22:56 PM: Jak Lau: How does a greedy bank that has a monopoly in HK collapse. Isn't that a fail!??!
1/28/14, 8:23:57 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Omg panic cash withdrawal from the back asap!
1/28/14, 8:24:09 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Wait no! Max it the credit cards and run!
1/28/14, 8:24:44 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: *Bank not back and *out not it
1/28/14, 8:31:22 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: But seriously if I can't get money out today for cny I'm kinda screwed and won't be able to do house visits..
1/28/14, 8:32:32 PM: Mike Ying: Where the banker people at to allay our fears?!?!?
1/28/14, 8:32:35 PM: Mike Ying: Hahaha
1/28/14, 8:32:38 PM: Jak Lau: Or give us lai see üò±
1/28/14, 8:33:39 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: üë∑
1/28/14, 8:33:50 PM: Donna Gee: Is Singapore opening a new bank!??
1/28/14, 8:33:56 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: In the UK they recently started making people explain why they wanted to withdraw their cash
1/28/14, 8:34:02 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/dealbook/2014/01/26/hsbc-apologizes-after-cash-withdrawal-issue-in-britain/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Investment%20Banking&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body
1/28/14, 8:34:07 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Omg....
1/28/14, 8:36:19 PM: Luisa Zhou: I think you still can get cash, I read HSBC only restricts big amout withdraw. The only question is how serious is the article and how it will affect the public? If everyone starts to get all their money from the bank then obviously they will run out of cash and will create a general panic, which will just make things worse.
1/28/14, 8:37:02 PM: Luisa Zhou: How much lai see are you planning to give us Cat üòç?
1/28/14, 8:38:15 PM: Neil Gysel: Hrmm, I wonder how serious to take this!
1/28/14, 8:38:26 PM: Neil Gysel: seems quite crazy.
1/28/14, 8:38:38 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: üôâ huh I can't hear I dunno what you mean üòù
1/28/14, 8:39:12 PM: Luisa Zhou: Let's all buy bitcoins! Fuck the banks!
1/28/14, 8:40:34 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Give lai see in bitcoin
1/28/14, 8:41:01 PM: CAL: HSBC - holy shit banking collapse
1/28/14, 8:44:39 PM: Luisa Zhou: Banks make money by putting people's money elsewhere. That's why you only see a number on your account. They do that because they know people need to store their money somewhere secure. Which is the central bank of HK? HSBC?
1/28/14, 8:45:41 PM: Luisa Zhou: Banks work on people's expectations and trust
1/28/14, 8:48:35 PM: Luisa Zhou: And if you think about it, money is exactly the same thing. It's just a mere contract between people of one society and among societies. It's just a piece of paper... I'm taking this too far üòÅ
1/28/14, 8:49:53 PM: CAL: How desperate are you Luisa? I can lend you $5
1/28/14, 8:52:03 PM: Neil Gysel: Ying,  give Luisa her phone back!
1/28/14, 8:54:07 PM: Luisa Zhou: Only 5?? I can't even buy toilette paper!
1/28/14, 8:54:52 PM: Donna Gee: Just use newspaper
1/28/14, 8:54:59 PM: Donna Gee: You get used to it after a while
1/28/14, 8:58:50 PM: Sam Axelrod: Left hand works as well
1/28/14, 9:00:41 PM: Luisa Zhou: I don't know which one is worse
1/28/14, 9:01:02 PM: Mike Ying: Sam has been reading up on muslim culture.
1/28/14, 9:02:46 PM: Luisa Zhou: Lol
1/28/14, 9:19:57 PM: Mike Ying: I'm pretty sure any of our banker friends would be able to quantify exactly how much a sentence about that HSBC stuff is worth. You guys wanna put money in a pool so we can afford to ask one of them for their opinion? üòã
1/28/14, 9:32:56 PM: Tuan Phan: Shit I have to withdraw a lot to go to Bali today since HSBC doesn't work in Indonesia. Piece of crap bank
1/28/14, 9:49:32 PM: Donna Gee: Central peeps lunch today with me and Luisa???
1/28/14, 10:25:53 PM: Kevin Ho: Where?
1/28/14, 10:26:20 PM: Donna Gee: Open to suggestions
1/28/14, 10:48:57 PM: Conor Quigley: The share price of HSBC hasn't changed today as of 10:30. The articles in the UK refer to changes made in November. I am sure the atms are limiting funds because it's CNY and they want people to get their Lai see money from the counter.
1/28/14, 11:38:08 PM: Donna Gee: <‚Äéimage omitted>
1/28/14, 11:38:09 PM: Donna Gee: That's my good!

1/29/14, 12:04:42 AM: Sam Axelrod: Invest in toilet paper
1/29/14, 12:07:46 AM: Kevin Ho: I thought it was fake
1/29/14, 12:17:25 AM: Jak Lau: Breaking news. Toilet paper stock just went up 200%
1/29/14, 12:25:18 AM: Neil Gysel: I also observed the recent trend in clean behinds has caused the KY Jelly stock price to jump by 69%... it is also the number 2 traded stock of the day!
1/29/14, 12:25:52 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Lol

1/29/14, 12:31:06 AM: Donna Gee: This also trebled the sales of hand Cream deemed as the shocker of the day
1/29/14, 1:25:04 AM: Lincoln Cheung: In other news 69ing is predicted to be at an all time high for the year of the horse.
1/29/14, 1:27:56 AM: Kim Alexanderson: A lot of horsing around
1/29/14, 1:38:44 AM: CAL: The price of lame jokes is dropping due to an oversupply - an expert in lame jokes
1/29/14, 1:39:50 AM: Mike Ying: Uuuuh, I think you are overestimating the optimum supply of lame jokes....
1/29/14, 1:40:53 AM: Donna Gee: Body lotion has been said to be in high demand due to the increase in bare back.
1/29/14, 1:40:59 AM: Neil Gysel: I can't focus on work.... I'm rearing out of control over here... I hope we're at the rear end of these jokes?
1/29/14, 5:52:52 AM: Tuan Phan: Just got upgraded randomly to business class to Jakarta. But when I land I'm gonna sleep at the airport to wait for morning flight to Bali. Heaven to hell and back again. Happy chinese break all!
1/29/14, 7:02:39 AM: Sam Axelrod: Go Neil Gallagher on them

"U.S. Investigators Suspect Missing Malaysia Airlines Plane Flew On for Hours"
" U.S. counterterrorism officials are pursuing the possibility that a pilot or someone else on board the plane may have diverted it toward an undisclosed location after intentionally turning off the jetliner's transponders to avoid radar detection"
" At one briefing, according to this person, officials were told investigators are actively pursuing the notion that the plane was diverted "with the intention of using it later for another purpose."

4/28/14, 11:20:20 PM: Sam Axelrod: Sure....MGM grand in Macau. 1230
4/28/14, 11:20:25 PM: Neil Gysel: We've tried to get more fields.. We had to move the date because of Shanghai tournament.
4/28/14, 11:20:38 PM: Neil Gysel: we had it set but it fell the same weekend as Shanghai.
4/28/14, 11:20:55 PM: Neil Gysel: so the board did a quick switch-a-roo to change the date.
4/28/14, 11:29:31 PM: Anton Delcamp: Do we know who will use the neighboring field(s)? I'm guessing associations, not private hire. Could we deal with them (bypass lcsd first) see if we could get some space? At least a few hours or so?  Like "we are a small association, help us make our event a success" (close to 150 registrations in 12 hrs)
4/28/14, 11:30:59 PM: Anton Delcamp: This being said, I can imagine it was trouble to get the dates changed. All effort greatly  appreciated. üòâ
4/28/14, 11:31:38 PM: Tim Orourke: Wilkie posted that the hk hat sign up was up at 8:19pm. I immediately checked the hkupa website and it wasn't there. I checked my emails, no link, on Facebook either. Where was it announced? Now it's full without it ever being posted? Wtf?
4/28/14, 11:33:57 PM: Neil Gysel: Well,  shit happens we went to work to make the event and someone sniffed wind of it.
4/28/14, 11:34:24 PM: Neil Gysel: HKUPA got hit with a leak scandal.
4/28/14, 11:34:41 PM: Neil Gysel: I'm on the waiting list if that makes you feel any better.
4/28/14, 11:36:16 PM: Neil Gysel: We're reviewing our options to try and make everyone happy.
4/28/14, 11:37:26 PM: Wilkie Chu: The registration info was posted on Facebook yesterday, just like any other tournament announcement...
4/28/14, 11:38:11 PM: Julia Yung: Let's do what the SZ hat did. Cut people who don't pay to guarantee their spots early. This will make space for the waitlisted people.
4/28/14, 11:38:33 PM: Clay Carol: What's for lunch?  I'm not here for that anyway.
4/28/14, 11:38:50 PM: CAL: People should stop assuming it's a first come first serve event
4/28/14, 11:44:00 PM: Tommy Fung: It was Edward Snowden
4/28/14, 11:45:01 PM: Anton Delcamp: Cal, isn't it though?
4/28/14, 11:46:29 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Im on waiting list too.
4/28/14, 11:48:08 PM: Tim Orourke: Wilkie, no, most tournaments are not announced on Facebook. They are announced through the UPA and later a Facebook page is made for announcements, etc
4/28/14, 11:50:26 PM: Neil Gysel: Anyhow,  the board is reviewing it and trying to make the best and fair solution. We're not out to screw anyone..  So hang tight and we'll work it all out.
4/28/14, 11:52:00 PM: Nicole Alpert: üò≥ you know how to make a gal feel unattractive.
4/28/14, 11:52:04 PM: Nicole Alpert: Cal gets it.
4/28/14, 11:52:11 PM: Tim Orourke: In fact a good deal of the people registered are in china and don't regularly use Facebook. How's that happen?
4/28/14, 11:52:34 PM: Nicole Alpert: Espionage doo doo do doooo
4/28/14, 11:52:52 PM: Nicole Alpert: Yes lunch shanghai in sheung wan!

4/29/14, 12:02:41 AM: Kim Alexanderson: New category for next year, 'best costume accessory'
4/29/14, 12:23:32 AM: Ruth Chen: I'm right behind Big Kim at whopping no. 138.
4/29/14, 1:03:51 AM: Lincoln Cheung: Reality for the hat : unless we get more fields, some people are going to be disappointed
4/29/14, 1:07:12 AM: Lincoln Cheung: Only 2 fields, and there was feedback from last year the teams were too big
4/29/14, 1:10:14 AM: Lincoln Cheung: As for the china crew getting a jump on registration I have no idea how that happened
4/29/14, 1:11:12 AM: Lincoln Cheung: Boycott mainland ? They take all our hospitals milk powder and hat spots. And pee on our streets !
4/29/14, 1:11:16 AM: Mike Ying: I'm pretty sure someone saw the fb thing and the China fanatcism took over.
4/29/14, 1:11:55 AM: Kim Alexanderson: I saw it but didn't realize it would be full already... Oh well
4/29/14, 1:12:07 AM: Nicole Alpert: Are there really going to be poop gatherings this wknd

4/29/14, 2:13:38 AM: Nicole Alpert: So many weird mattes these days. Matte navy is my least fav
4/29/14, 3:03:54 AM: Julia Yung: Re: HK Hat. Do we still have field at SYS on may 31?  Maybe we can have additional games there on sat?
4/29/14, 3:04:27 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Yes, it was discussed - a bit difficult we expect.
4/29/14, 3:05:42 AM: Anton Delcamp: But maybe we could swap that slot with whoever have a field in happy valley around the same time.
4/29/14, 3:18:53 AM: Sam Axelrod: That is what jeju does

6/20/14, 3:16:39 AM: Mike Ying: Yaaaah

6/20/14, 3:45:25 AM: Anton Delcamp: Conor rooting for Italy is totally unbiased, right?
6/20/14, 3:49:55 AM: Conor Quigley: Only Italy can save us now. Help me Obi Wan Baloteli, you're my only hope.
6/20/14, 3:53:58 AM: Anton Delcamp: But your plan still relies on a victory of England in their last game. Hopeful much?
6/20/14, 3:56:53 AM: Conor Quigley: If Italy win both games and England beat Costa Rica by about 2 goals England will go through.
6/20/14, 3:57:28 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Yeah Italy to beat Uruguay too...
6/20/14, 3:57:49 AM: Catherine Gainey: Sooo many ifs!
6/20/14, 3:57:53 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Imagine if they won all their games; but England lost to costa...
6/20/14, 3:57:56 AM: Catherine Gainey: Anyone watching island side?
6/20/14, 4:00:22 AM: Conor Quigley: Imagine if everything works out but Suarez scores Vs Italy in the last minute and England are out on goal difference.
6/20/14, 4:01:09 AM: Kim Alexanderson: I think Suarez would be banned from playing in the premiership
6/20/14, 4:01:39 AM: Anton Delcamp: Hooligans would take care of him.
6/20/14, 4:02:23 AM: Kim Alexanderson: He IS a hooligan....! Remember the biting incident ?
6/20/14, 4:04:04 AM: Conor Quigley: And the racism.

6/22/14, 7:41:26 PM: Sam Axelrod: He scored off the dick!
6/22/14, 7:42:55 PM: CAL: Hahahaha
6/22/14, 7:44:57 PM: Kristin Franke: So many memes possible with that shot of Dempsey scoring
6/22/14, 7:48:51 PM: CAL: Where can we buy Portuguese egg tarts?

6/22/14, 7:56:32 PM: Sam Axelrod: Fuck
6/22/14, 7:56:43 PM: Sam Axelrod: Ronaldo is good, perfect pass
6/22/14, 7:56:47 PM: Sam Huggins: Any one see the goal, I'm just on a ticker now, how was it?
6/22/14, 7:56:49 PM: Anton Delcamp: Didn't want it...
6/22/14, 7:57:13 PM: Sam Axelrod: Ronaldo with a perfect cross
6/22/14, 8:00:03 PM: Mike Ying: Yah US in the last dying moments failed to maintain possession and drain time off the clock. Lack of composure gave the free header in the end. And Michael Bradley kinda played like a donkey the whole game too.
6/22/14, 8:01:33 PM: Sam Axelrod: Yeah we should have kept attacking
6/22/14, 8:05:07 PM: Sam Axelrod: Happy nj sunset

6/22/14, 8:12:53 PM: Tuan Phan: One good cross from Ronaldo does not redeem his shitty game. What a douche. Murca!
6/22/14, 8:14:23 PM: Sam Axelrod: I need to know what kind of hair gel he uses. That shit is the bomb
6/22/14, 8:21:09 PM: Conor Quigley: Both USA and Germany will get through with a draw next game. I suspect Jurgen is already on the phone to Mr Loew
6/22/14, 8:40:35 PM: Sam Axelrod: Our coach is a German
6/22/14, 8:41:03 PM: Jak Lau: Sabotage!

6/24/14, 6:08:52 AM: Mike Ying: Hahaha.because gio has no friends hahaha
6/24/14, 6:13:29 AM: Giovanni Lion: We play Uruguay not us, your friends may be disappointed tuan
6/24/14, 6:14:49 AM: Giovanni Lion: I am not ready to deal with too much italianness
6/24/14, 6:15:39 AM: Kim Alexanderson: We could watch it at mine?
6/24/14, 6:15:55 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Gainey likes lots of italianess though...
6/24/14, 6:19:16 AM: Mike Ying: Pick a place! I'd say if Kim is ok with his place....
6/24/14, 6:19:54 AM: Luisa Zhou: Kim's place!

6/24/14, 6:23:25 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Don't listen to tommy... Kim's place!
6/24/14, 6:23:42 AM: Kim Alexanderson: And USA will win the ashes

6/24/14, 6:33:03 AM: Tommy Fung: Kim you have pay tv?
6/24/14, 6:34:32 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Oh yes!!
6/24/14, 6:34:47 AM: Kim Alexanderson: And a fridge full of booze
6/24/14, 6:35:12 AM: CAL: Who's in for watching Germany USA at that German pub next to the fields?
6/24/14, 6:35:10 AM: Mike Ying: And a heart full of love.
6/24/14, 6:35:30 AM: Mike Ying: And pants full of both booze and love.
6/24/14, 6:35:40 AM: Mike Ying: "German" pub.

6/24/14, 6:50:47 AM: Giovanni Lion: The 'german' one in pe is quite pricey on the weekends
6/24/14, 6:53:23 AM: Tommy Fung: German vs us will be boring
6/24/14, 6:53:38 AM: Tommy Fung: You know they are playing for the tie.
6/24/14, 6:54:17 AM: Conor Quigley: Agreed. A 0-0 borefest. Both teams will be in for a draw.
6/24/14, 6:54:22 AM: Giovanni Lion: Maybe there's some ww2 unsettled issues
6/24/14, 6:54:47 AM: Giovanni Lion: Or an unintentional own goal
6/24/14, 7:00:13 AM: Anton Delcamp: With the 1982 precedent, Germany will be scrutinised and may be highly criticized back home again if they don't play 100%.
6/24/14, 7:02:47 AM: Neil Gysel: *don't make and oven joke Neil...  don't do it*
6/24/14, 7:08:28 AM: Anton Delcamp: About Ying being baked?
6/24/14, 8:06:33 AM: CAL: Can I say, it's early but Donna is alone in dead las in our World Cup pool party by having Australia advancing and partly by picking Spain to win it all

6/24/14, 1:20:51 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Red?
6/24/14, 1:20:57 PM: Keith Stanulis: Yup
6/24/14, 1:21:11 PM: Keith Stanulis: That was like the 45th fowl
6/24/14, 1:21:19 PM: Chris Harrison: Yeah seemed like it came from no where. It was just a hard foul
6/24/14, 1:21:20 PM: Tuan Phan: Well, but also a lot of dramatics and acting. That's no red card. If I wanted to see such flopping I would have stayed home to look at my dick
6/24/14, 1:21:40 PM: Grant Franke: Keith and Chris, I'm now off for the summer. Hang out in NYC/Jersey!!!!
6/24/14, 1:21:55 PM: Keith Stanulis: That red card was for all the previous dramatics and hard challenges.
6/24/14, 1:22:01 PM: Keith Stanulis: Yes Grant!
6/24/14, 1:25:27 PM: Tuan Phan: Buffons been beast though. saving grace of an otherwise ugly match.
6/24/14, 1:25:30 PM: Chris Harrison: Lol @ tuan
6/24/14, 1:26:18 PM: Keith Stanulis: Do you miss next match from a red?
6/24/14, 1:38:33 PM: Tuan Phan: This is getting ridiculous
6/24/14, 1:38:43 PM: Keith Stanulis: Totally.
6/24/14, 1:39:00 PM: Keith Stanulis: Did Suarez bite him?
6/24/14, 1:39:44 PM: Tuan Phan: I think he was just head butting. Lol let me head butt my opponent then grab my head to get a foul.
6/24/14, 1:40:03 PM: Keith Stanulis: There it six
6/24/14, 1:40:06 PM: Keith Stanulis: Is
6/24/14, 1:40:08 PM: Jak Lau: Fffffffff
6/24/14, 1:40:44 PM: Keith Stanulis: Italy didn't deserve this win.

6/24/14, 9:17:36 PM: Neil Gysel: lol @ Tuan!
6/24/14, 9:17:37 PM: Neil Gysel: Well, but also a lot of dramatics and acting. That's no red card. If I wanted to see such flopping I would have stayed home to look at my dick
6/24/14, 9:18:57 PM: Nicole Alpert: It was so good it needed quoting.
6/24/14, 9:20:12 PM: Neil Gysel: I although I didn't expect to visualize tuans pecker this morning - it did make me laugh.
6/24/14, 9:20:38 PM: Neil Gysel: no wait,  the joke made me laugh Tuan. the joke.
6/25/14, 2:42:54 AM: Donna Gee: Yayay I'm not losing the bracket anymore;)
6/25/14, 2:48:56 AM: Lincoln Cheung: I am.
6/25/14, 2:53:59 AM: Tommy Fung: Wow you managed to get the entire top right bracket wrong. That's impressive actually.
6/25/14, 2:54:50 AM: Jak Lau: Woooo. Winning at losing!
6/25/14, 12:04:54 PM: Kim Alexanderson: INCREDIBLE!!!
6/25/14, 12:05:20 PM: Mike Ying: So siiiiiiiick!!!!
6/25/14, 12:06:36 PM: Tuan Phan: What a start!
6/25/14, 12:07:00 PM: Jak Lau: Oh no. What are we missing?!?
6/25/14, 12:07:27 PM: Tim Orourke: Did someone bite someone again??
6/25/14, 12:08:53 PM: Mike Ying: Two minutes into the game messi scores. One minute later Nigeria score.
6/25/14, 12:09:13 PM: Tim Orourke: No biting?
6/25/14, 12:46:04 PM: Mike Ying: Messi is genius.
6/25/14, 12:46:53 PM: Mike Ying: THAT IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT.
6/25/14, 12:46:54 PM: Jak Lau: Stuuuuuuud
6/25/14, 12:47:12 PM: Jak Lau: "This little genius"
6/25/14, 12:49:29 PM: Mike Ying: called it.
6/25/14, 12:50:19 PM: Mike Ying: But that's like saying a bear shits in the woods because messi is genius
6/25/14, 1:07:57 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Wuuutttttt
6/25/14, 1:08:17 PM: Jak Lau: That's bs!
6/25/14, 1:10:29 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: lol, this match is ridiculous
6/25/14, 1:13:44 PM: Kim Alexanderson: What the hell!
6/25/14, 1:19:28 PM: CAL: Yeah seriously. Bosnia Herzegovina is completely shutting down the Iranian offensive
6/25/14, 1:25:36 PM: Jak Lau: Why would you sub messi?
6/25/14, 1:25:44 PM: Jak Lau: Like. Honest q
6/25/14, 1:26:29 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Lots of matches to go!
6/25/14, 1:26:33 PM: Mike Ying: Game is inconsequential to them going through and they have the lead. Protect best player.
6/25/14, 1:27:08 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Also, did that shot break the dude's hand!? So fierce...

9/28/14, 12:32:10 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Yeah did all island side people get home okay? The taxi driver we had said you couldn't even access Gloucester Rd

9/28/14, 8:46:54 PM: Anton Delcamp: 2 exits blocked in CWB, maybe 3. Still a few people to block the road but strangely no (visible) cops, last night or this morning.
9/28/14, 8:48:23 PM: Neil Gysel: are people still out?
9/28/14, 8:48:39 PM: Neil Gysel: or did they all go home to charge their phones?
9/28/14, 8:49:00 PM: Grant Franke: Only if they have iPhones

9/28/14, 8:52:50 PM: Anton Delcamp: CWB yee wo street,looking west. That's sogo in the background. Protesters group stops before sogo but road is blocked further ahead.
9/28/14, 8:54:53 PM: Keith Stanulis: MTR still going?
9/28/14, 8:55:51 PM: Anton Delcamp: Yes, no problem here. Usual traffic.
9/28/14, 8:56:01 PM: Anton Delcamp: No more no less.
9/28/14, 8:59:38 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: MTR is crazy busy at admiralty

9/28/14, 9:00:15 PM: Keith Stanulis: Crazy busy, but ok?
9/28/14, 9:00:34 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Yeah, moving...
9/28/14, 9:01:03 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: I guess people are avoiding the roads and flooding the trains
9/28/14, 9:03:19 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: <‚Äéimage omitted>
9/28/14, 9:51:52 PM: Keith Stanulis: Thanks
9/28/14, 10:02:39 PM: Julia Yung: Cause the buses won't go further east. All passengers are dropped off at sheung wan

9/29/14, 1:46:28 AM: Clay Carol: Tim, how is your women of occupy calendar coming?
9/29/14, 1:46:45 AM: Anton Delcamp: Isn't Hsu only interested in open bar deals after HKUPA's open bar parties?
9/29/14, 1:52:13 AM: Tim Orourke: Men of Occupy calendar has Nick Tsao on the cover
9/29/14, 2:08:03 AM: Nick Tsao: Quite a lot of political schtoops around.
9/29/14, 2:08:41 AM: Jak Lau: Pictures or not true.
9/29/14, 2:11:14 AM: Tommy Fung: Is that why you're there Nick. Go tell them your nickname
9/29/14, 2:14:50 AM: Nick Tsao: Áà¨Ê¨ÑÁî∑fence climbing man
9/29/14, 2:37:50 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Áà¨Ê¨ÑÁî∑ - does this translate to BDN?
9/29/14, 2:48:32 AM: Mike Ying: Fence climbing man
9/29/14, 2:50:52 AM: Neil Gysel: should have been holding a Frisbee.
9/29/14, 2:51:00 AM: Neil Gysel: would be an epic where has ur disc been.
9/29/14, 2:51:25 AM: Anton Delcamp: He had to climb to escape from the horde of ferocious fans, ready to give up democracy for some time with Nick.
9/29/14, 3:00:27 AM: Lincoln Cheung: Someone date this man
9/29/14, 3:03:52 AM: Tommy Fung: Â§ßË≥ìÁî∑
9/29/14, 3:04:42 AM: Keith Stanulis: Anyone know if airport express will be accessible due to protests?
9/29/14, 3:05:00 AM: Lincoln Cheung: It's completely fine
9/29/14, 3:05:25 AM: Keith Stanulis: But taxi? Traffic-wise?
9/29/14, 3:09:58 AM: Jak Lau: I heard traffic through admiralty is slow
9/29/14, 5:35:13 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Anyone going to protest after work?
9/29/14, 5:39:11 AM: Charis Poon: Will be in admiralty ard 7:30
9/29/14, 5:39:20 AM: Charlotte Poon: Heading to walk from sheung wan soon
9/29/14, 5:40:27 AM: Jak Lau: Wanna check it out, but not today. Not right after a tourney.
9/29/14, 5:40:56 AM: Jak Lau: Mind and soul needs some noodles in a bowl.
9/29/14, 5:44:01 AM: Clay Carol: May watch from Sevva soon
9/29/14, 5:44:09 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Cool I'm going to go with a group of people between central and admiralty
9/29/14, 5:44:25 AM: Jak Lau: Lol clay
9/29/14, 5:45:05 AM: Julia Yung: Maybe after our game tomorrow?
9/29/14, 5:45:20 AM: Anton Delcamp: More people gathering in CWB. Though less than Admiralty of course.
9/29/14, 5:49:32 AM: Kevin Ho: I'll be there with Sondra
9/29/14, 5:49:44 AM: Kevin Ho: Probably admiralty/central

9/29/14, 6:06:11 AM: Tim Orourke: Nice day for it
9/29/14, 6:13:59 AM: Tuan Phan: Make sure you guys are somewhat equipped. I think it could get violent or at least tear gassy tonight. See yall around
9/29/14, 6:15:40 AM: Julia Yung: And locate the nearest washroom
9/29/14, 6:19:36 AM: Neil Gysel: Be safe everyone..  Big Brother doesn't mess around.
9/29/14, 6:19:46 AM: Neil Gysel: be ready for a fight!
9/29/14, 6:20:18 AM: Jana Evans: Yes, please be careful everyone!
9/29/14, 6:21:41 AM: Tim Orourke: It will surely get tear gassy, but the tear gas is fired right in the front where the protesters are facing off with the police. So it's possible to stand at a distance and not get gassed. Bring a small towel and wet it if the gas comes. Swim goggles or regular goggles with plastic wrap protect the eyes
9/29/14, 6:22:35 AM: Tim Orourke: Not really possible to find public toilets
9/29/14, 6:24:30 AM: Anton Delcamp: Occupy MTR
9/29/14, 6:25:12 AM: Tim Orourke: Sheung wan Mtr is at an impasse
9/29/14, 6:25:39 AM: Keith Stanulis: ??
9/29/14, 6:26:44 AM: Anton Delcamp: I didn't mean action in the mtr. I just met people in the mtr on their way there.
9/29/14, 6:26:55 AM: Anton Delcamp: <‚Äéimage omitted>
9/29/14, 6:27:03 AM: Tim Orourke: Cannot get in or out, too many people

9/29/14, 6:30:12 AM: Tim Orourke: Sheung wan station is so packed, workers are not letting people in
9/29/14, 6:33:21 AM: Nicole Alpert: I heard most riot police have been taken off the streets. A gov statement. Did they place them back?
9/29/14, 6:35:39 AM: Tim Orourke: I'm working till 11 so I don't know who is out there now
9/29/14, 6:40:34 AM: Anton Delcamp: All fine in CWB mtr! Despite 3 exits closed
9/29/14, 6:41:39 AM: Anton Delcamp: <‚Äéimage omitted>
9/29/14, 6:42:32 AM: Giovanni Lion: Prince edward mtr is ok too
9/29/14, 6:43:36 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: They're blocking direct access to central from mtr at prince Edward to make you go down the stairs
9/29/14, 6:44:44 AM: Clay Carol: IFC Apple Store appears to be closing early. OMG!!
9/29/14, 6:44:48 AM: Nicole Alpert: Is they the protestors?
9/29/14, 6:45:54 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: I mean the platform. Just weird ..
9/29/14, 6:46:23 AM: Neil Gysel: lol clay.

9/29/14, 7:14:02 AM: Neil Gysel: fuck her right in the pussy.
9/29/14, 7:14:42 AM: Anton Delcamp: But my dad is in town... üò¢
9/29/14, 7:15:21 AM: Anton Delcamp: Well, it'll be a fireworks of teargas instead.
9/29/14, 7:15:44 AM: Mike Ying: Uuuuuuh I'm pretty sure all day history making social protests  trump fireworks.
9/29/14, 7:16:25 AM: Giovanni Lion: Guerilla Radio - http://open.spotify.com/track/1yPQEVh4z4davqR8Y9iDQT

9/29/14, 9:24:08 AM: Kevin Ho: They'll have to disperse people in admiralty first for that to happen
9/29/14, 10:15:46 AM: Tuan Phan: Better stated is to say a massive protest/demonstration took place that was civil, friendly, and had crazy turnout. China can't blame any future violence on citizens cause this is what happens wout police presence

9/29/14, 11:55:14 AM: Tim Orourke: Where?
9/29/14, 11:56:27 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Brand name street area behind Mandarin oriental
9/29/14, 12:14:30 PM: Tim Orourke: Bob Markey, 'get up, stand up, stand up for your rights' blaring on a speaker
9/29/14, 12:15:30 PM: Tim Orourke: <‚Äéaudio omitted>
9/29/14, 1:02:53 PM: Shevaun Gallwey: Go Bob! Loving the live updates!
9/29/14, 1:06:25 PM: Anton Delcamp: In CWB, group reorganizes itself for the night. Some people left obviously but still a decent group. I walked around earlier and also saw 2 cops who almost seemed here for sth unrelated.
9/29/14, 1:09:17 PM: Anton Delcamp: I heard bad things from the mong kok gathering.  Danger since there is no obvious exit, weak organization and apparently triad members who would be there waiting to face police.
9/29/14, 1:11:54 PM: Tim Orourke: Tens of thousands occupying central/admiralty still but only a few cops near the govt building. Lots of cops surrounding the police headquarters on the way to Wan Chai. Cops lined up shoulder to shoulder both sides of Lockhart road all the way from the beginning to Fenwick street. Not sure why
9/29/14, 1:13:42 PM: Jana Evans: Cops also surrounding the PE police station but I didn't see any south of that towards MK.
9/29/14, 1:17:30 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: That sounds terrifying especially the cops in Wan Chai
9/29/14, 1:21:10 PM: Anton Delcamp: One guy that probably doesn't sleep much these days is the police commissioner.
9/29/14, 1:22:08 PM: Anton Delcamp: You charge demonstrators, you fuck up.  You let them be, you fuck up.
9/29/14, 1:22:35 PM: Kristin Franke: Are they surrounding the stations because they're worried about protestors storming them?
9/29/14, 1:22:42 PM: Kristin Franke: Or something like that?
9/29/14, 1:23:59 PM: Anton Delcamp: Yesterday, demonstrators were chanting for police to join the strike but i don't see how it could be related.
9/29/14, 1:27:33 PM: Anton Delcamp: A timelapse of CWB people trying to rearrange the barriers with the Benny Hill song would be very suitable. Where are the engineering students?
9/29/14, 1:33:35 PM: Tim Orourke: People are really pissed off at the police, but I don't see any scenario where protesters storm the police station. The citizens now hold the moral high ground and will definitely want to keep it that way
9/29/14, 1:34:15 PM: Tommy Fung: Kristin I assume the cops are out as pre caution. If they're not out there and a riot or looting takes place that would look pretty bad
9/29/14, 1:36:43 PM: Kristin Franke: Oh ok :-) I was making uninformed guesses
9/29/14, 1:38:01 PM: Tommy Fung: We're not a police state yet. üòÅ
9/29/14, 1:39:01 PM: Mike Ying: Oh you've jinxed it. When it happens everyone remember it's all Tommy's fault.
9/29/14, 1:39:22 PM: Tommy Fung: I have my zombie apocalypse preparation ready
9/29/14, 1:39:46 PM: Sam Axelrod: Perfect timing!

9/29/14, 1:40:24 PM: Tommy Fung: Nice
9/29/14, 1:42:59 PM: Tommy Fung: Maybe Hk just needs Sam back and everyone will calm down
9/29/14, 1:48:57 PM: Sam Axelrod: More chill less rage!
9/29/14, 2:02:42 PM: Keith Stanulis: What could Sam do? He's just an "IT" guy.
9/29/14, 2:14:38 PM: Nick Tsao: If you are joining any of the movements, go to admiralty or causeway bay. There is a feeling mongkok is getting messy
9/29/14, 8:47:15 PM: Anton Delcamp: 50-100 max still on the road in CWB, like yesterday morning. It should progressively come back during the day and peak tonight, especially with the next 2 days being public holidays. Police could definitely storm the place now and take it back with limited resistance. But at the risk of seeing people come back later.
9/29/14, 8:48:34 PM: CAL: How about getting to the fields tonight? Is cwb mtr closed? Do you think any of the cross harbor buses will make usual stops?
9/29/14, 8:49:09 PM: Anton Delcamp: No. Mtr totally fine.
9/29/14, 8:49:56 PM: Anton Delcamp: They even reopened at least one of the exits that was blocked yesterday (didn't see the others).
9/29/14, 8:50:46 PM: Anton Delcamp: Buses are rerouted. See relevant company websites for updated information.

10/10/14, 2:06:37 AM: Anton Delcamp: Admiralty: lunch time

10/10/14, 2:07:24 AM: Jak Lau: üòõ

10/10/14, 2:09:26 AM: Anton Delcamp: They are expecting 10,000 people tonight.

10/12/14, 8:24:38 AM: Lincoln Cheung: People are getting together on IFC roof red bar to have a post tourney hang out if anyone is up for it
10/12/14, 8:39:45 AM: Donna Gee: Wow!!! How on earth do you guys have any energy left!!
10/12/14, 8:40:06 AM: Donna Gee: Thanks again for running the tourney Cal and Gio and everyone else who helped
10/13/14, 12:30:13 AM: Sam Axelrod: Great tournament all. Great seeing everyone as well! Stop by Pakistan anytime
10/13/14, 12:33:06 AM: Jak Lau: #pakistanbeachtourney2015
10/13/14, 12:33:07 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Stop by - but you won't be able to stay or meet up with Sam
10/13/14, 12:33:38 AM: Neil Gysel: Great playing in the finals.

10/13/14, 7:07:34 AM: Anton Delcamp: <‚Äéimage omitted>
10/13/14, 7:08:18 AM: Nicole Alpert: People barrier?
10/13/14, 7:08:20 AM: Anton Delcamp: Gathering in CWB. It's getting tense.
10/13/14, 7:09:07 AM: Anton Delcamp: Some shouting. Police is monitoring.
10/13/14, 7:09:25 AM: Tim Orourke: They are in tents?
10/13/14, 7:10:08 AM: Tim Orourke: Sorry, still puns
10/13/14, 7:10:34 AM: Nicole Alpert: I laughed
10/13/14, 7:12:10 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: üòÖ
10/13/14, 7:12:16 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: So the anti occupy people are there?
10/13/14, 7:13:05 AM: Nicole Alpert: Yep. Since this am. Occupy to anti occupy.
10/13/14, 7:13:31 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: üòì
10/13/14, 7:17:24 AM: Conor Quigley: The police standing in Mong Kok earlier had their big banners with them. You know the ones that say stop or we will fire.
10/13/14, 7:18:11 AM: Nick Tsao: They always carry the yellow and red ones around.
10/13/14, 7:18:38 AM: Nick Tsao: Unless you see a black one handy, there shouldnt be anything out of the ordinary
10/13/14, 7:20:36 AM: Nicole Alpert: Nick if they clear the barriers there will be less spaces to occupy. Do you think there'll be another staged later?
10/13/14, 7:22:09 AM: Nick Tsao: I think both admirlaty and mongkok take up more space than they need to. They can afford to shrink a little in physical size to condense the people. You can clear a barrier but they will just rebuilt it again
10/13/14, 7:23:02 AM: Nick Tsao: Instead of sending 100 people to start fights, the triads should send 100 people to carry away the barriers. All at once. We have no defence against that. It might just work
10/13/14, 7:23:13 AM: Nicole Alpert: Are numbers dwindling tho?
10/13/14, 7:24:00 AM: Nick Tsao: They were but on friday it went right back up again cuz people werent happy with carrie lam's response
10/13/14, 8:08:07 AM: Kingi Lau: GZ jumble jumble hat tournament on 16 Nov ! The registeration is opened now !!

10/13/14, 9:38:00 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Happy anniversary!! ‚ò∫üòç
10/13/14, 9:54:01 AM: Nicole Alpert: Triple happiness week!
10/13/14, 11:53:33 AM: Anton Delcamp: Occupy CWB is on alert with threats of anti-occupy (or rumors) alternating on both sides.
10/13/14, 5:35:53 PM: Anton Delcamp: That's it.  Police takes over the street in cwb.
10/13/14, 5:36:35 PM: Anton Delcamp: Barriers are going away.
10/13/14, 5:36:57 PM: Tuan Phan: Ah that's just as well. Better there's a strong presence in admiralty.
10/13/14, 5:37:17 PM: Anton Delcamp: Police totally circle the place.
10/13/14, 5:41:10 PM: Anton Delcamp: Hundreds of policemen. They brought trucks to take barriers away once removed.
10/13/14, 5:45:29 PM: Anton Delcamp: <‚Äéimage omitted>
10/13/14, 6:01:33 PM: Anton Delcamp: Police ballet with supervisors handling positioning, spacing...
10/13/14, 6:07:05 PM: Anton Delcamp: Protesters are i guess taking care of gathering and packing items, banners, food... 
0 violence but i don't know how it was when police came in. With the numbers police came in with, i think they knew they couldn't do much.
10/13/14, 6:15:52 PM: Anton Delcamp: The message on speakers from the police and the current layout seems to show that only west bound yee wo street will be reopened (and other streets). Protesters are left on east-bound way and tram tracks. Single barrier layer to fence the area. It would be a trimmed protest area, not complete removal, although they could have.
10/13/14, 6:18:32 PM: Anton Delcamp: Protesters sweep the ground (on their side of the barrier) to remove papers left on the floor by police action.
10/13/14, 6:22:15 PM: Anton Delcamp: One protester sweeps as well within police cordon, as they look on.
10/13/14, 6:27:39 PM: Anton Delcamp: (sorry for the spamming)
10/13/14, 6:39:41 PM: Tuan Phan: All class protest, imo. I think they should just maintain admiralty now, it's frankly a better space than the industrial behemoth of roads and high rises it was before.
10/13/14, 7:05:24 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Thanks for the updates Anton
10/13/14, 10:20:41 PM: Luisa Zhou: Yup, greatly appreciated!
10/13/14, 10:21:11 PM: Anton Delcamp: Tear gas manufacturers may have lost HK police as a client for the time being but bolt cutters and chainsaw suppliers are still happy.
10/13/14, 10:29:04 PM: Anton Delcamp: An update for tonight's games: check with relevant companies but original bus routes should have been restored WEST-bound in CWB. East-bound still diverted. Tram tracks still blocked there. No problem with mtr. 
Again, check companies updates since police action is on the way in various places.
10/13/14, 10:33:01 PM: Mike Ying: Antonews, there for you. Merci!
10/14/14, 6:26:05 AM: Rie Kimura: Does anyone have any idea where I could buy a cover for outdoor furniture?
10/14/14, 6:39:35 AM: Conor Quigley: Ikea maybe
10/14/14, 6:53:35 AM: Rie Kimura: Oh, you're right. Never thought of it...thanks!
10/14/14, 7:10:21 AM: Chris Harrison: Pauly sells em
10/14/14, 7:15:05 AM: Rie Kimura: Chris! Thought if it but never seen it in his office before...
10/14/14, 7:18:03 AM: Chris Harrison: Prob in catalog so he might not keep em stocked
10/14/14, 7:19:53 AM: Rie Kimura: Right. I need it rather urgently so I'll try ilea first. Thank you Chris:)
10/15/14, 5:31:21 AM: Donna Gee: Do you realise!!!! Ahhhh ahhhhh
10/15/14, 5:31:38 AM: Donna Gee: That the flaming lips are playing clockenflap!!!!!! Best festival ever!!!
10/15/14, 5:31:49 AM: Keith Stanulis: What?
10/15/14, 5:32:04 AM: Jak Lau: The flaming lips Keith.
10/15/14, 5:32:26 AM: Sam Axelrod: They are big in Japan
10/15/14, 5:32:50 AM: Mike Ying: And hopefully mogwai.
10/15/14, 9:50:21 AM: Tim Orourke: Still at woolamaloo? Just finishing work
10/15/14, 9:55:42 AM: Nicole Alpert: Yep! Come over
10/15/14, 10:50:32 AM: Ruth Chen: <‚Äéimage omitted>
10/15/14, 10:51:29 AM: Nicole Alpert: Lol
10/15/14, 10:52:16 AM: Nicole Alpert: The police are tired and unprepared here. When was the last time we saw them in action except for that one dept. chasing after hawkers.
10/15/14, 10:57:08 AM: Nicole Alpert: Don't watch the video tho going around from today it'll make you sick.
10/15/14, 10:58:09 AM: Neil Gysel: Chris Brown did more damage solo then the 12 cops! too soon?
10/15/14, 10:59:10 AM: Nicole Alpert: This is why I never win charades. I don't pop culture
10/15/14, 9:53:05 PM: Jak Lau: Favourite story of my day: Protesters were stopped by police when carrying bamboo to build a structure in MK. 
Later, allowed to go when they provided a receipt of purchase.
10/15/14, 9:53:28 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Oh lol
10/15/14, 9:55:03 PM: Nick Tsao: I like the one where a group of young triad members get paid $600 each to dismantle a few barricades. Then they used the money to buy material resources for the protests.
10/15/14, 9:55:50 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Hahaha wow didn't hear any of these stories
10/15/14, 10:21:00 PM: Mike Ying: üëçüëç
10/15/14, 11:35:33 PM: Lincoln Cheung: Rooftop IFC lunch !

10/15/14, 11:47:59 PM: Mike Ying: Yay, ill be there earlier to scope a spot.
10/15/14, 11:48:40 PM: Nicole Alpert: :)
10/16/14, 12:13:40 AM: Mike Ying: Fyi Kennedy town to admiralty is gridlock
10/16/14, 12:13:59 AM: Jak Lau: Thanks Anton.
10/16/14, 12:14:33 AM: Mike Ying: üëç
10/16/14, 12:35:22 AM: Mike Ying: I got the couches upstairs in front of red.
10/16/14, 12:47:53 AM: Mike Ying: No one is up here yet right??
10/16/14, 12:51:56 AM: Nicole Alpert: I'm here coming over

10/16/14, 6:47:49 AM: Grant Franke: Tuan's daughters!
10/16/14, 6:48:27 AM: Tim Orourke: I was afraid to ask
10/16/14, 8:07:27 AM: Mike Ying: <‚Äéimage omitted>
10/16/14, 8:07:49 AM: Mike Ying: They're coming!
10/16/14, 8:09:07 AM: CAL: Not the first one to take that picture Ying...
10/16/14, 8:20:48 AM: Mike Ying: Uuuuh I have a life, I dont keep a track of how many times people take pictures of the sticker on the new stations. üòù
10/16/14, 8:21:35 AM: Nicole Alpert: Ooo I haven't seen that yet!
10/16/14, 8:32:56 PM: Tuan Phan: Anyone know if cwb and Victoria park are open and cleared of protestors and potential conflict?
10/16/14, 8:33:01 PM: Tuan Phan: Anton?
10/16/14, 9:08:10 PM: Kevin Ho: Yeah VP is fine, passed by it yesterday
10/16/14, 9:13:46 PM: Tuan Phan: Thanks
10/16/14, 10:42:40 PM: Anton Delcamp: There never was occupation in Victoria park. Yee wo street still occupied, on east bound lane and tram tracks. West bound lane open for traffic.
10/16/14, 11:06:30 PM: Nicole Alpert: Going to tai long wan to BBQ giant marshmallow snores tonight
10/17/14, 2:09:57 AM: CAL: Anyone want a sweet 3 seat couch?
10/17/14, 2:11:09 AM: Rie Kimura: Wanda may. You might want to ask her.
10/17/14, 2:11:43 AM: Tim Orourke: Pics?
10/17/14, 2:13:49 AM: Jak Lau: You can be confident it's stain free Tim.
10/17/14, 2:16:13 AM: CAL: If I post a pic will you promise not to make fun of how messy my apartment is?
10/17/14, 2:16:44 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: You're so unreasonable
10/17/14, 6:10:43 AM: Nick Tsao: We need two people to run 18D at tai po on sunday 1-5pm üò¨
10/17/14, 10:06:56 AM: Anton Delcamp: Careful in mong kok. It's tense!
10/17/14, 10:07:49 AM: Jak Lau: You live in MK too?!!?
10/17/14, 10:08:11 AM: Mike Ying: What's happening?
10/17/14, 10:08:24 AM: Gigi Law: Antonin news is everywhere
10/17/14, 10:08:35 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: What's going on..?
10/17/14, 10:08:38 AM: Anton Delcamp: They try to retake the streets.
10/17/14, 10:09:09 AM: Mike Ying: Any pepper spray?
10/17/14, 10:09:17 AM: Anton Delcamp: I'm glad no one's yet been hit by a car or stepped on.
10/17/14, 10:09:27 AM: Mike Ying: And gigi knows where you live...
10/17/14, 10:09:35 AM: Mike Ying: Wish.
10/17/14, 10:09:36 AM: Mike Ying: Woah.
10/17/14, 10:10:08 AM: Anton Delcamp: Didn't see pepper if it happens,  hard for people to escape. It's packed!
10/17/14, 10:10:10 AM: Tuan Phan: Anton for hkupa president! His updates give me a boner (said w a French accent)
10/17/14, 10:10:26 AM: Anton Delcamp: And i quit!!
10/17/14, 10:11:19 AM: Anton Delcamp: (live tvb feed if you want to follow)
10/17/14, 10:13:19 AM: Tuan Phan: Arg, why take back Mongkok? If protestors want to sustain support keeping to admiralty is the way to go.
10/17/14, 10:13:49 AM: Anton Delcamp: I totally agree.
10/17/14, 10:14:21 AM: Mike Ying: It's lack of movement leadership.
10/17/14, 10:14:37 AM: Anton Delcamp: A mix between continuing the movement and minimizing disturbance.
10/17/14, 10:27:05 AM: Mike Ying: <‚Äéimage omitted>
10/17/14, 10:28:17 AM: Tim Orourke: I think they should have given up Mong Kok and CWB long ago. The govt refused to talk, a unilateral decision to give up disruptive areas and consolidate in Admiralty would have given them the high ground for taking the initiative to resolve things even if the govt wasn't
10/17/14, 10:30:05 AM: Mike Ying: <‚Äéimage omitted>
10/17/14, 10:30:46 AM: Tim Orourke: It's good they stayed a couple days after hired thugs tried to force them out showing their resolve, but voluntarily leaving would show maturity and a willingness to compromise even when the govt refused talks
10/17/14, 10:36:10 AM: Mike Ying: This poor guy is surrounded!
10/17/14, 10:37:42 AM: Mike Ying: People are throwing money at him!!
10/17/14, 10:38:21 AM: Ed Lee: Making it rain?
10/17/14, 10:43:27 AM: Mike Ying: <‚Äévideo omitted>
10/17/14, 10:45:17 AM: Luisa Zhou: What are they saying?
10/17/14, 10:46:36 AM: Mike Ying: Open the roads!
10/17/14, 10:48:23 AM: Anton Delcamp: Remake of July 1st. It will end up as being the action of one person, taking the street and asking others to join.  Cars will be trapped for hours.
10/17/14, 10:48:58 AM: Mike Ying: There are cops everywhere.
10/17/14, 10:58:32 AM: Anton Delcamp: Who's covering for Getty? Paula Bronstein, a veteran conflict zone photog. Now in custody for standing on a car to protect herself from the crowd.  She tried to explain to police arresting her that it was common in conflict zone. New to Hong Kong law & order, i presume?

10/18/14, 1:35:12 AM: Mike Ying: Anyone wanna come play pickup at Sun yat sen from 3-6?
10/18/14, 1:36:17 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Pickup from 430!
10/18/14, 1:36:55 AM: Ed Lee: Not if there's a training implosion on one side
10/18/14, 1:37:45 AM: Mike Ying: Yuuuuuuuuuuup
10/18/14, 1:37:48 AM: Ed Lee: Apparently everyone caught hepatitis or something
10/18/14, 1:38:22 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Fun Friday night?
10/18/14, 1:38:23 AM: Tim Orourke: Ebola

10/24/14, 9:36:31 AM: Anton Delcamp: I went to mong kok yesterday. But too unstable/temporary. Argument starting every now and then. It doesn't beat the atmosphere of Admiralty Village.

10/27/14, 9:07:29 AM: Tuan Phan: Damnit, too far away agaib
10/27/14, 11:29:38 AM: Tuan Phan: Just had an idea. Would a hookup app designed just for lkf net me some cash money? Streamline it all, make efficient. Users interested list the bar they're in and the level of intoxication, and they're matched w similar members of the intoxicated and interested sex by algorithm because they might be too drunk to match themselves. A gps guide offers helpful directions to bring them together, connects w uber to bring them to nearest hourly hotel. Could be a big winner.
10/27/14, 11:32:44 AM: Tommy Fung: Lol stick with teaching English
10/27/14, 11:33:47 AM: Tommy Fung: You're dangerously close to going into the pumping business
10/27/14, 12:09:13 PM: Mike Ying: OK computer, where is Tuan and what have you done with him
10/27/14, 12:50:14 PM: Chris Harrison: Did u have an idea tuan or did you want that specific app so u can use it to pick up chicks?
10/27/14, 12:51:47 PM: Tommy Fung: By pump I meant pimp
10/27/14, 12:52:07 PM: Neil Gysel: pumping business could also work though
10/27/14, 12:52:27 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Pump it till it pops!
10/27/14, 12:53:32 PM: Neil Gysel: Tuan will just have to pump off until his app is finished.
10/27/14, 2:01:17 PM: Mike Ying: App only deemed successful if someone can use it fully blacked out.
10/27/14, 2:02:21 PM: Mike Ying: You would call it STDer.
10/27/14, 7:15:13 PM: Donna Gee: Lol

10/29/14, 8:04:46 AM: Anton Delcamp: Nothing on the website. I haven't been told there was 101.
10/29/14, 9:25:05 AM: Neil Gysel: That's my fault.
10/29/14, 9:25:07 AM: Neil Gysel: :)
10/29/14, 9:28:30 AM: Tommy Fung: Wow it's packed at Hv
10/30/14, 1:48:12 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Hey, need a bit of help for Halloween party... If anyone is near, or will go past an elec shop (supposedly you can't get in Broadway island side); DJ needs to get this cable (pic coming) that is 5-10m length.

10/30/14, 2:26:16 AM: Charis Poon: @tuan: "Tinder for afterparties" http://www.kickon.com/
10/30/14, 2:39:58 AM: Mike Ying: Ask and ye shall receive. Hook up apps. And so the Lord decreed and Charis his faithful enabler provideth unto Tuan. A hook up app.
10/30/14, 2:43:39 AM: CAL: <‚Äéimage omitted>
10/30/14, 2:44:04 AM: CAL: Unrelated to tinder talk
10/30/14, 2:50:47 AM: Charlotte Poon: Also unrelated to you
10/30/14, 2:51:40 AM: Charlotte Poon: Tho helpful, I hadn't looked at the player pack yet
10/30/14, 2:53:19 AM: Nicole Alpert: Original choice of theme. Wish I had a visa
10/30/14, 2:54:36 AM: Charis Poon: Or is it related? Tuan could still develop a schtoops specific hook up app
10/30/14, 2:58:44 AM: Mike Ying: Beauty is in the eye of the phoneholder.
10/30/14, 3:00:20 AM: Tuan Phan: I don't think schtoops need a hookup app, hahaha. That's what lkf is for! My app is more for those willing to admit they've got major beer goggles on and looking for other beer goggled in the wilderness of lkf. Flexible standards! Now kickon, I'll have to test that out... Cool concept, though!
10/30/14, 3:08:26 AM: Neil Gysel: So basically ur looking for a tinder for ugly people!?
10/30/14, 3:09:02 AM: Tuan Phan: Or beautiful women with low self esteem?
10/30/14, 3:11:43 AM: Charis Poon: Or tinder for the realists who are honest about their attractiveness
10/30/14, 7:02:17 AM: Grant Franke: Where did the real Tuan go, and/or what have you done with him?!
10/30/14, 7:33:06 AM: Nicole Alpert: What did NYC do to you.
10/30/14, 8:03:20 AM: Clay Carol: Is wearing a Vikings jersey and carrying a switch in bad taste?
10/30/14, 8:03:27 AM: Clay Carol: Too soon?
10/30/14, 8:08:10 AM: CAL: Hahahahahaha I don't think most people will get it
10/30/14, 8:09:00 AM: Tommy Fung: I saw a picture of somebody with a ray rice Jersey dragging around a blow up doll on the ground
10/30/14, 8:09:10 AM: Tim Orourke: In a Raven's jersey dragging arising a blow up doll?
10/30/14, 8:09:43 AM: Tim Orourke: Tommy beat me to it!
10/30/14, 8:09:47 AM: Mike Ying: You can borrow my vikings jersey

10/30/14, 8:12:08 PM: Neil Gysel: I hope the blond hype man is back! He was my fav.
10/30/14, 8:12:44 PM: Anton Delcamp: Keith is blond?
10/30/14, 8:14:02 PM: Anton Delcamp: (probably the Japanese fashion... )
10/30/14, 9:00:09 PM: Catherine Gainey: The way he scanned that crowd, smoked that cigarette...legendary.

11/12/14, 3:49:34 AM: Anton Delcamp: Rosetta comet landing webcast: with tattoos and pinup shirt, that scientist is killing the physics nerd cliche.
11/12/14, 3:53:30 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Omg great shirt and hair! The watch and pants are not so good, but excellent overall
11/12/14, 3:54:41 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Wait to see if they can stick the landing first....
11/12/14, 3:56:40 AM: Anton Delcamp: The distance (data comes with a 30min delay) and the shape of the comet just add to the challenge.
11/12/14, 3:58:09 AM: Jak Lau: I thought they've done it before. There was even a documentary about it with Bruce willis.
11/12/14, 3:59:16 AM: Anton Delcamp: Yeah but they exploded it instead of getting the hard disk back with data. N00bs.
11/12/14, 4:01:49 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: <‚Äéimage omitted>
11/12/14, 9:07:21 PM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Didn't explode! #livinginthefuture!
11/12/14, 9:10:14 PM: Jak Lau: #ultimateremotecontroltoy
11/12/14, 9:22:06 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: science! üöÄüå†üî≠
11/12/14, 10:25:49 PM: Anton Delcamp: It took them 10 years to travel the distance, that thing is 4km wide, with a weird shape and they still bothered with finding a landing side, which it reached after a 22-km, 7-hour free fall. Talk about brains.  But still, can't put another man on the moon, too expensive.

1/19/15, 8:37:45 AM: Grant Franke: Read on for info on an HK battle of the bands that my friend is in... If you want to go/cheer/heckle him and others on üòä

Hi Guys,

Been a while and happy 2015! Just to let you know that my friend Nate and I have been selected to play in the AIA Carnival's "Battle of the Bands" competition that starts next week. Our heat is on Wednesday (Jan 28) evening next week and we'll be playing two songs (one cover and one original) on the main stage at the AIA Carnival on the Central Waterfront across the road from IFC.

We will be on the stage at 8:45pm sharp and will play to exactly 8:53pm as we only have seven minutes to play our two songs. We will need all the help we can get to progress onto the semifinals: this is a shameless popularity contest and bands will be judged by the audience reaction to our performance as measured by a decibel meter. Obviously this can work to our disadvantage too because if we suck there is a risk we will be heckled off the stage. Either way it's all for fun and will hopefully be a good night out.

Let me know if you can make it - you'll have to buy a ticket at the door to get into the Carnival area first but fingers crossed we'll make it worthwhile for you guys. And if all else fails, your ticket will give you tokens to spend on the rides or F&B at the carnival too so all in all a win-win situation if you come out. Feel free to invite your friends, colleagues, plus ones, family members, relatives, stalkers etc. The more the merrier so hopefully see you all next Wednesday!

Cheers,¬†

Aaron (& Nate) aka "SPAM" (short for Solomons Porch Awesome Musicians)

3/5/15, 1:59:43 AM: Donna Gee: If I don't make the HK squad for australia then I'll play. Otherwise I'll be away.
3/5/15, 2:03:29 AM: Mike Ying: "She said casually, knowing full well that she would be an integral part of the HK team, playing in her home country, which she had trained balls out for. Was it superstition? Was it modesty that made her say that? Whatever the answer, Donna knew instinctively she would be handcuffing Jak tonight."
3/5/15, 2:03:55 AM: Donna Gee: Hahahhaha lol
3/5/15, 2:04:02 AM: Donna Gee: Ying you're hillarious!!
3/5/15, 2:06:04 AM: Mike Ying: Story time!
3/5/15, 2:08:30 AM: Kirk Kahu: I think Lewis is a master is kwayzar. On a side note imagine this word with a triple word score.
3/5/15, 2:19:24 AM: Tommy Fung: Yes and he is very adamant that it is NOT laser tag.
3/5/15, 2:19:39 AM: Tommy Fung: But it totally is the same
3/5/15, 2:20:46 AM: Lincoln Cheung: The refresh rates on the laser modules have a different frequency
3/5/15, 2:21:51 AM: Jak Lau: And there are glitches in the software you can exploit.
3/5/15, 2:27:04 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Quasar I think is the correct spelling
3/5/15, 7:10:27 AM: Tuan Phan: Everyone should google under the dome documentary, it's the video that's gone viral about China's air pollution. It's good. YouTube has it w English subtitles. I don't know how long the gov will let the documentarian live, but man making it is crazy gutsy
3/5/15, 8:03:57 AM: Tuan Phan: She has a dig at hangzhou, which apparently is under haze more than 200 days per year, mostly from car pollution
3/6/15, 5:06:10 AM: Nicole Alpert: Neil can I have the Agm food recipes
3/6/15, 5:06:10 AM: Nicole Alpert: So yum

3/6/15, 5:28:12 AM: Donna Gee: Interesting...
3/6/15, 5:41:13 AM: Anton Delcamp: Don't know much about 7s, but those matchups in rugby league would be great games.
3/6/15, 5:43:54 AM: Nicole Alpert: What are you guys doing tonight? Let me love vicariously. I'll be here w tissues and cuddle beasties as blankets.
3/6/15, 5:45:09 AM: Catherine Gainey: I wanna love vicariously too! Spare no details please. ;-)
3/6/15, 5:46:50 AM: Luisa Zhou: Hi Gainey! How cold is London? Are you getting depressed yet? Coming back soon? üòÉ
3/6/15, 8:24:30 AM: Grant Franke: Donna, the Frankes really liked that HongKabulary photo you shared
3/6/15, 8:25:23 AM: Lewis Glover: Gainey is going to be in Dubai now

3/8/15, 6:55:32 AM: Grant Franke: Y'all should watch Kristin. USA is playing Germany in 4 minutes
3/8/15, 6:55:36 AM: Grant Franke: http://www.wcbu2015.org/
3/8/15, 7:06:35 AM: Grant Franke: http://live.wcbu2015.org
3/8/15, 7:07:20 AM: Tim Orourke: Thanks Grant!
3/8/15, 7:07:44 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Nice
3/8/15, 7:08:36 AM: Grant Franke: But after the anticipating countdown to the start time, there's now that terrible screen of "starting soon..."
3/8/15, 7:08:46 AM: Tim Orourke: Saw that
3/8/15, 7:09:19 AM: Grant Franke: I guess it is the very first game of the whole tournament
3/8/15, 7:15:58 AM: Nicole Alpert: Oo it's on my screen. Waiting!!
3/8/15, 7:19:30 AM: Grant Franke: Kristin threw a score! USA up 3-2
3/8/15, 7:20:06 AM: Tuan Phan: Whooohoo looks good. Major lag on my laptop though
3/8/15, 7:20:15 AM: Grant Franke: Me too sadly
3/8/15, 7:21:43 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Whoo hoo
3/8/15, 7:30:37 AM: Grant Franke: You guys still have lagging issues? It's driving me nuts
3/8/15, 7:31:18 AM: Nicole Alpert: Yea dude. I am gonna stream it later.
3/8/15, 7:31:36 AM: Nicole Alpert: Can't get a second without lag but I'm gonna watch after :)
3/8/15, 7:31:51 AM: Grant Franke: Prolly a good call (as long as they archive the games)
3/8/15, 7:32:15 AM: Nicole Alpert: Oo good point I assumed they would. Will they ?
3/8/15, 7:32:49 AM: Grant Franke: No idea. This is the first game
3/8/15, 7:50:01 AM: Sam Axelrod: "Ill advised throw by Franke"
3/8/15, 7:50:14 AM: Sam Axelrod: The nerve! Receiver error!
3/8/15, 8:00:50 AM: Grant Franke: Hhahaha
3/8/15, 1:42:35 PM: Catherine Gainey: Did you guys see Kristen throw the game winning score?!? With a HAMMER?!?
3/8/15, 1:42:39 PM: Catherine Gainey: I did!
3/8/15, 2:50:25 PM: Grant Franke: Oh yeah!
3/8/15, 6:49:07 PM: Donna Gee: Awesome!!!!!
3/9/15, 12:20:30 AM: Tommy Fung: We need some highlights from you now Gainey. Just only throw hammers for everything
3/9/15, 12:21:11 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Any layout for every catch
3/9/15, 12:21:15 AM: Jak Lau: Got to go bigger! No-look scoober
3/9/15, 12:52:19 AM: Sam Axelrod: Gainey what team are u on?
3/9/15, 1:40:13 AM: Lewis Glover: Gb women
3/9/15, 3:11:19 AM: Tim Orourke: Though the game ended at 12-8, the players decided to honor international women‚Äôs day by playing one extra point.  The commentator for the fields jokingly stated that the point had to be scored with a hammer.  The Germans turned this disc over and the Americans found themselves on the goal line.  The crowd chanted ‚ÄúHammer, Hammer‚Äù and it seemed clear that there was no other way for this point to end Jessica Jones made a cut to the breakside and Kristen Franken put up the hammer and scored the honorary point.  All in all a very nice way to kick off WCBU. (They spelled Kristen's last name wrong)
3/9/15, 3:12:56 AM: Mike Ying: Next Halloween I wanna see a couple scary Franke-steins!
3/9/15, 3:42:57 AM: Anton Delcamp: Gainey: 3 scores for their first game! (against UAE.  Nice way of saying "thanks for hosting")
3/9/15, 3:43:22 AM: Wilkie Chu: üëç
3/9/15, 3:44:35 AM: Donna Gee: Yeah and Tim you spelt Kristin's first name wrong!
3/9/15, 3:44:37 AM: Donna Gee: Lol
3/9/15, 3:47:02 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Gainey is my hero
3/9/15, 3:47:09 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Did gb win?
3/9/15, 3:47:59 AM: Anton Delcamp: 13-3. So, kinda, yes.
3/9/15, 4:35:30 AM: Jak Lau: ‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è‚òîÔ∏è
3/9/15, 7:19:27 AM: CAL: This Saturday is 3.14.15 aka super pi day. Thinking of having people over during the day or drinks the previous night

3/9/15, 8:02:38 AM: Conor Quigley: Is there anyone who plays cricket who isn't a part of the commonwealth?
3/9/15, 8:02:43 AM: Conor Quigley: The Queen always wins
3/9/15, 8:04:16 AM: Lewis Glover: Netherlands
3/9/15, 8:04:53 AM: Conor Quigley: Good shout!
3/9/15, 8:06:06 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: A true powerhouse
3/9/15, 10:22:58 PM: Anton Delcamp: WCBU2015: As of this morning, USA women is 3 for 3 (including vs Canada 10-8) with Kristin at 2 assists and 1 score.

3/9/15, 10:26:02 PM: Grant Franke: Can't stay awake! Gotta get up early to teach children
3/9/15, 10:26:08 PM: Grant Franke: But I'd love to
3/9/15, 10:26:33 PM: Lewis Glover: Get up for a power watch :)
3/9/15, 10:27:06 PM: Anton Delcamp: You want to avoid spoilers or can we comment here Grante?
3/9/15, 10:27:09 PM: Lewis Glover: Or build the replay in to your lessons the next day!
3/9/15, 10:28:11 PM: Lewis Glover: My maths class is going to be calculating the area and circumference of discs today :)
3/9/15, 10:38:22 PM: Grant Franke: Comment away! No problem
3/9/15, 10:49:31 PM: Jak Lau: Next lesson- flight physics of an IO flick.
3/9/15, 10:51:41 PM: Anton Delcamp: You mean the force generated on the hand block, Jak?
3/9/15, 11:02:57 PM: CAL: Looks like the newest version of Anton news comes with burns
3/10/15, 2:53:31 AM: Anton Delcamp: GB leads 5-3. Last score by...  Gainey!
3/10/15, 2:53:59 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Wow, is this game live stream?
3/10/15, 2:55:48 AM: Anton Delcamp: Scoresheet yes. No video that I can see.

3/10/15, 4:34:43 AM: Clay Carol: Why didn't HK send a team
3/10/15, 4:35:32 AM: Neil Gysel: I blame the new president personally.
3/10/15, 4:35:45 AM: Clay Carol: I blame the old president
3/10/15, 4:36:06 AM: Kevin Ho: Nobody on HKUPA plays for HK at beach tournaments anyway
3/10/15, 4:36:43 AM: Neil Gysel: we actually tried to form a team I think.
3/10/15, 4:36:51 AM: Neil Gysel: not enough interest?
3/10/15, 4:37:06 AM: Nicole Alpert: Ooo kho lol
3/10/15, 4:37:18 AM: CAL: Not enough interest. Only 3 girls filled the form
3/10/15, 4:37:24 AM: Tommy Fung: Not allowed to drink or make out on the beach I think did it.
3/10/15, 4:38:36 AM: Mike Ying: Fuck Dubai.
3/10/15, 4:38:38 AM: Tommy Fung: Compared to boracay that's like...prison
3/10/15, 4:39:11 AM: Mike Ying: It's worse than a prison.
3/10/15, 4:41:05 AM: Mike Ying: I take that back. Depends on the prison.
3/10/15, 4:42:46 AM: Mike Ying: But still yes, you couldn't pay me to travel to Dubai.
3/10/15, 4:43:40 AM: Anton Delcamp: I got paid to travel to Dubai (b trip). Was OK üòä
3/10/15, 4:50:21 AM: Mike Ying: Adult, male, white, traveling alone on business. That's pretty much, give us your money and get the fuck out.
3/10/15, 4:52:10 AM: Anton Delcamp: Not alone, with hk bosses, but yeah.
3/10/15, 4:53:06 AM: Anton Delcamp: Every people we asked whether they like living there replied "I'm here to work". That speaks volume.
3/10/15, 4:53:58 AM: Mike Ying: Yeah fuck Dubai.
3/10/15, 5:04:17 AM: Neil Gysel: shit just got real!
3/10/15, 5:06:06 AM: Jak Lau: <‚Äéimage omitted>
3/10/15, 5:06:36 AM: Mike Ying: Hahah nah shit gets real when you get arrested in Dubai for Allah knows what.  Where almost anything you do as a foreigner could be construed as offensive.
3/10/15, 5:06:58 AM: Kim Alexanderson: One grain of erb...
3/10/15, 5:24:50 AM: Nicole Alpert: <‚Äéimage omitted>

3/10/15, 5:36:11 AM: CAL: Is he performing in English?
3/10/15, 5:37:41 AM: Mike Ying: Probably
3/10/15, 5:38:10 AM: Jak Lau: Doesn't matter to you anyway cal
3/10/15, 5:38:25 AM: Jak Lau: Correct?
3/10/15, 5:50:39 AM: Anton Delcamp: Gainey broke worlds. Since that score, no update on that game. We know scores of the games after that but no news re. USA vs GB...
3/10/15, 5:51:00 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: They are still playing that point
3/10/15, 5:51:15 AM: Nicole Alpert: Lol
3/10/15, 5:51:25 AM: Tim Orourke: Must be close to hard cap then
3/10/15, 5:52:11 AM: Anton Delcamp: That point is so long that part of the respective teams went to play their next games.
3/10/15, 5:52:33 AM: Grant Franke: In related news, USA women's masters beat GB 13-1
3/10/15, 5:53:19 AM: Anton Delcamp: Even you don't know Grant??
3/10/15, 5:53:24 AM: Tommy Fung: Maybe gainey and Kristin started making out and then got arrested
3/10/15, 5:53:35 AM: Anton Delcamp: Kristin's own PR agent
3/10/15, 5:54:46 AM: Grant Franke: There must be an update somewhere on the ladies, because I saw that USA women beat CUR 9-3? Or that's halftime?
3/10/15, 5:55:03 AM: Grant Franke: <‚Äéimage omitted>
3/10/15, 5:59:02 AM: Anton Delcamp: That was their next game
3/10/15, 6:00:47 AM: Anton Delcamp: With 1 assist and 1 score for Kristin (Callahan?) 
On UK side, they went on to defeating Russia 9-7 (no points for Gainey)
3/10/15, 6:01:26 AM: Anton Delcamp: (sorry, wasn't a Callahan)
3/10/15, 6:02:27 AM: CAL: Vivek's act in Cantonese is really funny and novel. In English I think he's pretty average
3/10/15, 8:57:51 PM: Nicole Alpert: Thanks - that's what I heard too.
3/10/15, 9:32:51 PM: Grant Franke: USA is currently 36-0 at beach worlds üò≥

3/12/15, 5:23:59 AM: Gigi Law: Like they are spinning the wheel of fortune
3/12/15, 5:24:18 AM: Gigi Law: I guess. But I'm not entertained!
3/12/15, 5:24:25 AM: Tommy Fung: You don't want to give the other team a short field
3/12/15, 5:24:34 AM: Jana Evans: Jak, that car crash was a Porsche. Two Cathay pilots, 27 yrs old. :(
3/12/15, 5:24:39 AM: Tommy Fung: I think the wind has died down a bit though
3/12/15, 5:25:39 AM: Jak Lau: Yeah. I read. Also can guess what those two tiny tents where for too :(
3/12/15, 5:25:57 AM: Tommy Fung: Layout d. Dragons break
3/12/15, 5:26:16 AM: Tommy Fung: See they should've hucked
3/12/15, 5:26:29 AM: Gigi Law: Wow. I think dragons might take this one.
3/12/15, 5:28:37 AM: Gigi Law: So close. Okay I almost yelled at work
3/12/15, 5:34:16 AM: Jana Evans: It's 5-5 Yinger!

3/12/15, 5:38:29 AM: Tim Orourke: Usa scores and takes the lead
3/12/15, 5:39:49 AM: CAL: Hard to decide who to root for
3/12/15, 5:40:08 AM: Jak Lau: #php
3/12/15, 5:40:28 AM: Conor Quigley: That catch in the end zone by dragons was in at 5-5!
3/12/15, 5:40:59 AM: Jana Evans: I thought his knee was down. Was close.
3/12/15, 5:41:18 AM: Tuan Phan: Philippines come on, usa wins everything
3/12/15, 5:41:39 AM: Mike Ying: Hope to gawd
3/12/15, 5:41:51 AM: Mike Ying: This game sounds awesome

If you bought your phone from a network apple won't fix it for you. Must go through the network and they charge more.
9/16/15, 10:41:19 PM: Tim Orourke: Not true Conor
9/16/15, 10:42:14 PM: Tim Orourke: That used to be the case that if you bought from Smarttone you needed to go to Smarttone service centre, not any more
9/16/15, 10:42:50 PM: Conor Quigley: Ok. Last year I tried to get the charger port fixed and apple told me I had to go to 3. They may have changed policy or may be different for screens. Just a heads up.

9/23/15, 9:17:10 AM: Shevaun Gallwey: Bandit

Loving home needed for stunningly beautiful male Bengal.

Approx 8 yrs old. Desexed and vaccinated and in great health.

I was going to take him back with me at the end of the month but found out I can not, as these guys are CITES regulated in the UK and I need proof of 5 generations of pedigree (which I cant get).

Currently in HK he has had a full-time helper to entertain him (and he loves and needs the attention) and as I will be travelling a lot for work in the UK, I‚Äôm worried about leaving him alone. As awful as it makes me feel to lose him I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs probably best for him if I find him a wonderful home here.


He‚Äôs quite an amazing cat, he looks you in the eye and talks to you and is so affectionate. He is almost double the size of a regular cat. He has lived with many dogs and with 5 other cats over the years and has only not gotten along with one cat (a surly little female I once rescued). Currently he has a small garden (and has never learned to climb the fence) but I think he‚Äôd be fine in an apartment as long as he has lots love and somewhere he can lie in the sun.

He seems to like water and my helper has started bathing him, which he is fine with.

Please call Nikki on 91041667 (please whatsapp or leave SMS) or email nikkigreen@netvigator.com if interested.

10/11/15, 6:41:52 AM: Conor Quigley: Someone out Michael Hsu'd Hsu!
10/11/15, 6:42:50 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: That is patently impossible
10/11/15, 6:42:59 AM: Tim Orourke: Ken Su was a much better Michael Hsu this year
10/11/15, 6:43:20 AM: Tim Orourke: Who won?
10/11/15, 6:43:51 AM: Conor Quigley: Naming a team after yourself is a very Michael Hsu thing to do. So the award was won by Dean. The captain of the team 
Dean And Friends.
10/11/15, 6:44:44 AM: Tim Orourke: That makes sense, he even out ego-ed Hsu this time
10/11/15, 6:45:41 AM: Conor Quigley: Dean from Dean And Friends was clearly the best Michael Hsu at the tournament.

10/11/15, 7:12:35 AM: Tim Orourke: A back massage?
10/11/15, 7:15:28 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: Hey if he's not doing very well maybe he might need to get his stomach pumped. Not to be a Debbie downer (I know I am) but I read somewhere that more than 13 shots in quick succession can be fatal.
10/11/15, 7:23:02 AM: Conor Quigley: This guy drank a lot from the disc. I'm very surprised he managed to finish it all. He might need an ambulance.
10/11/15, 7:28:32 AM: Mike Ying: Ooooh yeah that's why I stuck around. Called ambulance already.
10/11/15, 7:34:28 AM: Nicole Alpert: Thanks Mike

10/11/15, 9:03:38 AM: Holly McHugh: Any update on the drinker?
10/11/15, 9:13:42 AM: Mike Ying: Still breathing and at hospital now, doc hasn't seen him yet. He should be fine and sleep it off but just want to be sure.
10/11/15, 9:20:47 AM: Holly McHugh: Thanks Ying.
10/11/15, 10:54:18 AM: Sam Axelrod: It looks like Carlos is about to fist him

2/19/16, 5:54:02 AM: Tanis Heriot: So...I've been laying low lately. Haven't done anything active for a while. Didn't sign up for Spring league & missed BKK Hat that I was excited about...

...Been having troubles with Fatigue and getting out of bed. Started to think I was allergic to my job and burnt out from shift-working. Actually I was almost hating on my job (I love my job). Thought it was making me ill, the long flights... I was calling in sick for shifts, then finally took sick leave in Dec.

Several blood tests later and...
2/19/16, 5:55:26 AM: Tanis Heriot: ...EBV anti-bodies? What? You mean I had Mono (Glandular Fever) and didn't know it?!! We called that the "kissing disease" in school! üòÇ
Phew! Glad the Lyme disease & bone marrow cancer test came back negative!!

Looking forward to seeing some of you tonight! Plus getting the energy to play some Ulti again soon!

(PS. Not contagious, test said "latent phase". I'm just tired all the time...and relieved that it's nothing serious!)
2/19/16, 5:56:51 AM: Tim Orourke: So we can kiss??

2/20/16, 10:10:23 PM: Grant Franke: We are brave sailors always riding the sea
We are less than one hundred but as tough as can be
We sleep in three bunkers on top of each other
Our numbers double from one bunker to another
We dance in joy all through the night
In groups of fives under the moonlight
Last night twelve of us were swallowed by waves
Leaving alive more than two third of the braves
Still we continue the journey refusing to fail
So tell me how many of us are left to sail?

2/27/16, 12:26:39 AM: Wanda Yuen: Clay started laughing when Justin Bieber was taking selfie before he died AND he's the only person in the cinema laughing.

2/27/16, 12:29:45 AM: Wanda Yuen: oh I shouldn't say only person laughing. It's more his/their laughter really stood out

3/1/16, 5:41:20 AM: Holly McHugh: Mex

3/1/16, 7:32:28 PM: Nicole Alpert: Starbucks taking their coffee to Italy. What's that going to be like?
3/1/16, 8:06:42 PM: Holly McHugh: Asked an Italian colleague yesterday... He said he's thrilled but why would anyone go to Bux for a ‚Ç¨4 cappuccino when a croissant and cappuccino is ‚Ç¨2.2 anywhere else.
3/1/16, 8:10:19 PM: Tuan Phan: All sorts of naming confusion will ensue. Grande latte... Or medium coffee with some milk?
3/1/16, 8:12:21 PM: Holly McHugh: Exactly because a flat white is what an Italian expects when they order a cappuccino.
3/1/16, 8:34:23 PM: Nicole Alpert: Maybe sbucks coffee will improve!
3/1/16, 8:34:39 PM: Nicole Alpert: But only in Italy lol. That's not going global.
3/1/16, 8:35:12 PM: Nicole Alpert: What's sbucks like in Vietnam?
3/1/16, 8:35:43 PM: Holly McHugh: No clue. They tend to keep the coffee the same but customize the food to local taste
3/1/16, 8:40:53 PM: Ruth Chen: Didnt sbux try and failed in australi against the awesome local cafes?
3/1/16, 8:42:31 PM: Nicole Alpert: Sounds right. Feel like that would happen in VN too
3/1/16, 8:43:11 PM: Nicole Alpert: Ruth did you start your new job yet!?
3/1/16, 8:43:48 PM: Wanda Yuen: Think they failed Italy before. What makes sbux confident to come back?
3/1/16, 8:44:20 PM: Holly McHugh: No they never tried in Italy. That was where they got the idea though
3/1/16, 8:44:48 PM: Tuan Phan: Starbucks is alive and well in Vietnam, along with loads of local chains and curated mom and pop cafes. All people ever do in Vietnam is drink coffee. Starbucks does offer Vietnamese coffee there though. Has to
3/1/16, 8:49:22 PM: Jason Cancel: Wanda, you're thinking of Folgers
3/1/16, 8:50:45 PM: Clay Carol: Really
3/1/16, 8:50:51 PM: Clay Carol: We still talking about coffee?
3/1/16, 8:57:16 PM: Nicole Alpert: No we are talking about how your mama smells so bad she walked by a skunk and got him high
3/1/16, 8:58:13 PM: Nicole Alpert: Jason - Folgers! Surprising.

3/10/16, 4:04:37 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Where's the party......?!!
3/10/16, 3:18:49 PM: Tuan Phan: Hey peeps, especially Luisa, Lien Hoffman, who plays for Boston Brute Squad is in town and will probably come to pickup this Saturday. Brute squad is the 2015 women's champions for the US. She's friends with a frisbee friend of mine in Vietnam and just wanted to come play a bit.
3/10/16, 3:20:11 PM: Tuan Phan: FYI in case there's a women's team training you want her to join or talk to about the women's team program in the states. Pickup is fine but it's a shame to not take advantage of a women's player at that level swinging by.
3/10/16, 3:42:23 PM: Kristin Franke: She's a BALLER. absolute baller
3/10/16, 3:44:54 PM: Kristin Franke: http://youtu.be/vyd8IT6nWAc

3/10/16, 6:26:01 PM: Tuan Phan: Can't wait to try to get schooled by her in pickup. üòçüòç
3/10/16, 6:26:37 PM: Donna Gee: Super schtoooooooops
3/10/16, 6:26:46 PM: Tuan Phan: I say try, but getting schooled will be easy. I've been watching her Callahan vids, holly smak daddy.
3/10/16, 6:27:09 PM: Kristin Franke: And she's better now than her Callahan vids

3/10/16, 6:42:46 PM: Kristin Franke: Yea that was my guess. With a last name of Hoffman
3/10/16, 6:50:25 PM: Tuan Phan: Yah just confirmed with my Vietnamese frisbee friends. Her moms viet and dads Jewish I suppose
3/10/16, 6:51:35 PM: Tuan Phan: In other frisbee news, feel free to come down to happy valley from 4:30 - 6 to see a friendly between my school and a semi finalist school in this years hk student tourney.
3/10/16, 6:52:06 PM: Tuan Phan: We'll open it to friendly pickup after an hour of the game since I'd expect it to be pretty uneven. :)
3/10/16, 7:27:23 PM: ‚Äé‚ÄéCatherine Munkara-Kerr's number was changed from ‚Ä™+61¬†472¬†594¬†519‚Ä¨ to ‚Ä™+61¬†481¬†833¬†338‚Ä¨. ‚ÄéTap to add.

3/10/16, 9:53:49 PM: Jana Evans: Happy birthday Kristin!  Seems like yesterday we were sitting on the beach on your bday before playing boracay open! 

Tuan: Would it be possible to get in touch with her tho? See if she's willing to run something first and it gives her time to plan.
3/10/16, 9:54:28 PM: Donna Gee: watch out tuan she's trying to cut your grass!
3/10/16, 10:20:34 PM: Holly McHugh: Tuan, share with the other kids
3/10/16, 11:01:28 PM: Tuan Phan: Jana are girls practicing separately from junk tomorrow? I think Luisa wanted to see if she could help her with the women's team. She's traveling in Shenzhen and will only be available until Sunday morning. She just wrote in saying she wanted to come to pickup, but if you'd like her to talk to junk or practice with junk I'm happy to tell her.

3/15/16, 1:58:39 AM: Tanis Heriot: No, I asked when I made the booking and they said they could get a Veggie Pasta or Pizza from the restaurant downstairs!

(Thought BRAZA sounds like a big Meat fest...which might not seem to Veggie friendly.)

Let me know Shevaun and I can ask for you!

3/17/16, 8:06:38 AM: Lewis Glover: A bit of a sombre request...one of Jess' friends is suffering from anxiety / panic attacks. His Dr has been dismissive. He is looking for a second opinion. Asking in our professional circles isn't really an option but I thought id try my luck here as this group is such a diverse, caring group. pm me of you have any Dr or professional suggestions. Lewis
3/17/16, 8:08:06 AM: Wanda Yuen: clinical psychologist he is looking for?

4/21/16, 11:14:57 PM: Jason Cancel: I think the just print those at the beginning of the year for notable artist and throw them away if they don't use them. 
Tower records finally stopped making them for Keith Richards after he cost them so much in printing
4/21/16, 11:18:47 PM: Anton Delcamp: Nice one Jason. If it were true, how depressing for those involved to know of a shelf with stacked foamboards showing your hypothetical death.

Thx for sharing pics and congrats!! üéâ‚ù§
4/25/16, 3:26:05 AM: Rie Kimura: Just a random work related question. How many of you guys know what "ootd" means? Is it a very common term among young generation? Or not generational but more about if you're into social media or not kinda thing? Really appreciate your input!
4/25/16, 3:26:59 AM: Lincoln Cheung: Out of the dank
4/25/16, 3:27:05 AM: Jason Cancel: I just learned it about 2 weeks ago
4/25/16, 3:27:16 AM: Wanda Yuen: outfit of the day?
4/25/16, 3:27:28 AM: Anton Delcamp: I had to google it so there's my input.
4/25/16, 3:27:39 AM: Jason Cancel: Yes
Someone hash tagged a photo and I had to look it up
4/25/16, 3:27:44 AM: Tim Orourke: There's this new thing the kids are using called 'the Internet' you could look there
4/25/16, 3:28:13 AM: Rie Kimura: Yeah, thank you:) I know the meaning but want to know if it's a veeeery common term everyone knows.
4/25/16, 3:28:19 AM: Anton Delcamp: I dropped the "the" Tim. I'm so hype.
4/25/16, 3:28:24 AM: Rie Kimura: Or not.
4/25/16, 3:29:05 AM: Rie Kimura: So wondering how many of total 65 here would know.
4/25/16, 3:29:26 AM: Wanda Yuen: never saw that in conversation among my church youths
4/25/16, 3:29:37 AM: Jason Cancel: Survey monkey time
4/25/16, 3:29:38 AM: Neil Gysel: Isn't it related to a sale..  Offer of the day?
4/25/16, 3:30:12 AM: Quentin Kwong: Outfit of the day . I saw that on some fashion blogs
4/25/16, 3:30:29 AM: Rie Kimura: It actually is outfit of the day.
4/25/16, 3:30:32 AM: Neil Gysel: Like today's ootd is bukkake udon
4/25/16, 3:30:55 AM: Rie Kimura: I like your interpretation too though Neil.
4/25/16, 3:30:57 AM: Jason Cancel: Would that qualify as an outfit also?
4/25/16, 3:31:00 AM: Rie Kimura: Example too
4/25/16, 3:31:17 AM: Neil Gysel: My example could possibly work for an outfit  too?
4/25/16, 3:31:24 AM: Jason Cancel: Yes
4/25/16, 3:34:20 AM: Rie Kimura: Ok, so it is safe to say that it is not really a common term every English speakers as well as Japanese speakers would know right?
4/25/16, 3:36:59 AM: Jason Cancel: Maybe more common with young women or people who are really into clothes.
4/25/16, 3:37:28 AM: Quentin Kwong: It's more like an Internet slang
4/25/16, 3:38:28 AM: Quentin Kwong: I don't think it's very common terms for everyone
4/25/16, 3:38:54 AM: Rie Kimura: Great! thank you guys! üíñüíñüíñ
4/25/16, 3:47:51 AM: Tim Dodwell: Would be appropriate for an office worker but for me, I don't get to choose my ootd.
4/25/16, 3:48:08 AM: Tim Dodwell: Unless you talking socks
4/25/16, 3:48:46 AM: Tim Dodwell: But in that case it would be sotd
4/25/16, 3:50:44 AM: Anton Delcamp: Pilots don't chose their underwear? Tough.
Or maybe you're going command(o).
4/25/16, 3:51:06 AM: Wanda Yuen: üòÇ

4/26/16, 3:21:38 AM: Tuan Phan: Happy valley. Plenty of space for you to throw around or join us if you'd like. We could probably use a few more for numbers for full scrimmage
4/26/16, 3:32:26 AM: Jason Cancel: More advanced notice helps
4/26/16, 3:57:47 AM: Tuan Phan: It does, but I also can't book fields until rather last minute some weeks. Will keep that in mind.

5/29/16, 6:22:07 AM: Tuan Phan: Hk afra did great! Got to semis and lost to nanmo the team we beat in finals. I believe they ended up 4th by losing the third place game to Beijing champs

5/29/16, 6:27:11 AM: Jason Cancel: That was a deep pull or a dump to get a Callahan. That kids got a good future in ultimate ahead of him

5/29/16, 8:22:20 AM: Tuan Phan: No mythical sevens from my team. I think we had so many different players step up at different times. Amazing tournament. Great finals and even better semifinals
5/29/16, 8:22:59 AM: Wanda Yuen: I remember Henry. He came out in the last practice
5/29/16, 8:24:01 AM: Tuan Phan: <‚Äéimage omitted>

5/31/16, 11:34:51 AM: Jason Cancel: Donna D,
Sorry I didn't have time to answer you during the point. The rule is 11.7 if you want to look it up. 
Basically, if Tiff was out of bounds when she touched it (the side line is considered out), the the disc goes back to where it first went out (in the air). If Tiff was in, the that is considered contact with the playing field and the disc would be out there.
5/31/16, 11:43:20 AM: Donna Dubet: Hahah, thanks Jason!! üëçüèΩüòÉ
5/31/16, 12:08:19 PM: Donna Gee: I think you should refer to rule 12.1 Donna's are always right
5/31/16, 12:09:05 PM: Malindi C-T: I thought that was rule 1.1
5/31/16, 12:09:44 PM: Jason Cancel: We switched to wfdf rules about 6 years ago so that one doesn't count anymore
5/31/16, 12:20:25 PM: Lincoln Cheung: I was pretty sure tiff was out of bounds when she touched it
5/31/16, 12:21:10 PM: Lincoln Cheung: But the real winner here is sportsmanship !
5/31/16, 12:25:34 PM: Jason Cancel: She asked about clarification on the positioning after the turn, not questioning the call.

6/1/16, 6:01:24 AM: Kim Alexanderson: K-spot maybe...
6/1/16, 6:02:23 AM: Michael Hsu: J, pls don't name! lol.  It's called K-Bus next to the gas station.  Though Hours Bar across the police station has a $120 for 6 bottles on Strongbows!

6/1/16, 6:17:20 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Eye of an eagle mr tommy
6/1/16, 6:17:29 AM: Tuan Phan: In American school years, 7th grade to 10th grade. All a mixture of those years
6/1/16, 6:17:53 AM: Lewis Glover: Cool
6/1/16, 6:19:36 AM: Tuan Phan: Tbh I didn't think we'd make finals, they're really green. But we beat discovery college by a hair. And barely won against Lewis's team, haha.
6/1/16, 6:20:51 AM: Lewis Glover: Haha...my team left pretty battered and bruised...I hope they are too demoralised üò≥

6/1/16, 7:57:38 AM: Wanda Yuen: Thanks
6/1/16, 8:08:51 AM: Tuan Phan: CIS champions Hk last year and last fall, LUAC champs this spring. I was telling them it's become a rivalry, like lakers vs Celtics
6/1/16, 1:13:32 PM: Wanda Yuen: Watch the videos, and you can tell the kids from both teams have improved a whole lot!!! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYBEng6rbQcNc8qJnbcmdENZgM7Ttm7SY
6/1/16, 1:36:52 PM: Wanda Yuen: Thank you Tuan for bringing two more scoreboards to the tournament!
6/1/16, 7:40:09 PM: Jason Cancel: So is the Lutheran team sponsored by a tampon company or did they just make an unwise name choice?
6/1/16, 10:36:53 PM: Tim Orourke: Anyone seen Hsu recently?
6/1/16, 10:37:02 PM: Tim Orourke: http://www.foxla.com/news/local-news/150494977-story

6/2/16, 1:40:17 AM: Wanda Yuen: Lewis, is no. 5 Matthew who came out student training on 21 May? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfhTMpGBnjI&list=PLYBEng6rbQcNlX-HN8BClWez5Qyg1RhFJ&index=38
6/2/16, 1:41:37 AM: Tommy Fung: Are they hobbits?
6/2/16, 1:46:19 AM: Wanda Yuen: They were just too young...vid was a year ago
6/2/16, 2:09:27 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Hey Wanda, there is a large kid in your VDO (with facial hair!!!) - he seems ok, but perhaps Lewis could teach him to huck..
6/2/16, 2:15:48 AM: Wanda Yuen: You mean the big kid in this picture? http://www.sportsoho.com/pg/photos/view/5213650/#5213661
6/2/16, 2:29:44 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Yeah, I think that's the same kid.. although he's wearing a white jersey #12 in the VDOs... - someone went through puberty early.. or is having some learning difficulties...
6/2/16, 2:58:33 AM: Jason Cancel: Sometimes they hold kids back if their birthdays come late. Helps them to not be so far behind the rest of their class
6/2/16, 3:05:15 AM: Tuan Phan: That kids pretty jacked, clearly been hitting the gym and 'roids.
6/2/16, 3:17:13 AM: Wanda Yuen: Think I am more curious to know about if the tiny no. 5 is Matthew. Ying you are a big fan of him!
6/2/16, 3:48:13 AM: Mike Ying: That kid hustles and actually has good form and focus. Always cheer for the outsiders, the underdogs, the bad ass!
6/2/16, 3:57:49 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Go YING!!!' ;)
6/2/16, 4:01:43 AM: Lewis Glover: No 5 is Matthew... He basically runs Frisbee club
6/2/16, 4:23:29 AM: Wanda Yuen: Wow! That kid's great! too bad didn't get a chance to say hi to him yesterday. He looked a lot bigger than in the vid last month when we saw him!
6/2/16, 4:25:01 AM: Lewis Glover: Yeah...they tend to grow at the age.

6/2/16, 12:03:28 PM: Holly McHugh: Oops
6/2/16, 12:04:46 PM: Nick Tsao: You can so what kim did...? Cross the boarder to sz, get a visa on the spot and fly from there
6/2/16, 12:10:30 PM: Kim Alexanderson: I had to get a letter from an agency to show at the border and get a special visa on the spot. Then train to airport and fly... To the SHOw - and dominate!!
6/2/16, 12:14:39 PM: Jessica Yam: Think we found a solution! The 72 hour transit visa
6/2/16, 12:15:45 PM: Nick Tsao: Transit visa you have to exit to a third country
6/2/16, 12:18:29 PM: Jenna B: If you need sweet potatoes to hold you over, Yam‚Ä¶ I gotchoo covered üòÇ

6/24/16, 12:17:44 AM: Tuan Phan: Fish and chips just got so cheap now, at the least y'all can enjoy the strong hkd for the time you're there
6/24/16, 12:18:28 AM: Clay Carol: I prefer Brisket
6/24/16, 12:19:02 AM: CAL: If you discriminate against people who voted leave, does that make you brexist?
6/24/16, 12:35:15 AM: Conor Quigley: It's not legally binding. Don't worry.

6/24/16, 1:06:12 AM: Mike Ying: Miss out on Euro 2016, join the EU hm fair trade, no pun intended
6/24/16, 2:20:09 AM: Karen Mok: http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results
6/24/16, 2:23:50 AM: Tuan Phan: I hope someone British explains the reasoning behind this decision to me sometime. From my outsiders perspective it seems like voting for a 15% pay cut, based on effects so far on the pound and markets. I never thought it'd happen.
6/24/16, 2:24:54 AM: Jason Cancel: You can ask Alex Chapman, he's been promoting leaving on fb for a while
6/24/16, 2:28:43 AM: Tuan Phan: From what I've read and from immediate ramifications it just seems so logically terrible. It reminds me of blue collar folks in Kansas continuing to vote republican even though it's the party that screws them the most. Every year.
6/24/16, 2:34:17 AM: Lewis Glover: I can't explain it... It's stupid...as is the whole trump thing... Too many people,  not educated enough to realise that they are hurting themselves when they believe they are protecting themselves :(
6/24/16, 2:35:14 AM: Tuan Phan: It honestly has made me a wee terrified for this upcoming election.
6/24/16, 2:36:08 AM: CAL: Same
6/24/16, 2:40:56 AM: Conor Quigley: I agree with Lewis. I don't understand why people voted to leave. Some are afraid of unregulated immigration from the EU, some feel that the European Parliament dictates too many rules and we are losing sovereignty. Some just wanted a change. I'm very shocked at the outcome. It will be interesting to see how the government plays it this week.
6/24/16, 2:44:44 AM: Shevaun Gallwey: From the trenches- Farage on TV earlier 6am revelling in having a few pints already. Keeps saying that it is a victory for 'decent people'.. üò≥üò≥üò≥
6/24/16, 2:57:08 AM: Lewis Glover: I'm just going to close my eyes for a decade or so and hope it all goes away
6/24/16, 3:00:24 AM: Shevaun Gallwey: Alex supports UKIP üò≥üòî
6/24/16, 3:01:16 AM: Mike Ying: Yyyyyeeeeeaaaaaah have you guys heard of Plato's allegory of the cave? The fact that brexit or trumps popularity are even "close" to victory before the actual result should be telling enough that people are waaaayyyyy outta touch with each other. Neither result should be "surprising". But this is what happens when people dont dictate their decision-making with even a thought to compassion and empathy. Like this shit with the gun control?  It is ridiculous! We should be careful not ti demonise working class people either.
6/24/16, 4:13:46 AM: Lewis Glover: David Cameron is resigning
6/24/16, 4:14:06 AM: Wanda Yuen: yes we are reading the news
6/24/16, 4:14:16 AM: Wanda Yuen: new leader expected in fall
6/24/16, 4:18:45 AM: Kerry Dandie: Brilliant. Run the country into the ground, so much so that they believe morons like Nigel Farage, then fuck off at the worst part!

6/24/16, 5:15:58 AM: Karen Mok: A reliable resource told me: 
 it works both ways and uk will still do well without relying only the eu
6/24/16, 5:23:57 AM: Jak Lau: Hsu is not a "reliable" source.
6/24/16, 5:24:34 AM: Sam Axelrod: That's Mr. HSU TO YOU
6/24/16, 5:54:21 AM: Clay Carol: What's next, CHEXIT?
6/24/16, 5:56:29 AM: Karen Mok: Reliable source = CEO of DHL 
NOT HSU üòÇüòÇüòÇ
6/24/16, 6:08:39 AM: Tuan Phan: I always suspected Mr. Hsu was a big shot, but ceo of dhl, whoa consider me impressed, Hsu! üëç
6/24/16, 6:20:13 AM: Nick Tsao: My only real source of info is from load os fb posts, but my impression is that people have not had enough time or information to make the decision based on facts and economics. Most of the propaganda on both sides seems to have been mostly speculation. For example, are they sending millions of pounds away or are they receiving ¬£10 pounds for every ¬£1 they give? It all seems to me quite rushed for a decision that will affect them for decades. You cam see from the distribution maps that a lot of major cities have voted remain, those are the places that run the businesses and undeestand the economic impact....

7/27/16, 12:40:41 AM: Sam Axelrod: Yeah is it hardware or software? Does the computer see the drive?
7/27/16, 12:41:14 AM: Jak Lau: Have you tried a restart? ü§ì

7/27/16, 8:03:14 AM: Tuan Phan: So cool/interesting. I posted a picture of me next to a painting of Ho Chi Minh on Instagram and tried twice now to update it to fb also. Won't work. I'm pretty convinced the gov is filtering anything potentially libelous to uncle ho.
7/27/16, 8:06:39 AM: Tuan Phan: And does this mean I'm on a list? Whoa... Super innocent pic, too.

7/27/16, 8:25:14 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: yeah but Sam is on the secured Freedom Tubes
7/27/16, 8:25:15 AM: Tuan Phan: But I'm serious about fb not uploading. I even tried on fb app itself, no pic. Just gonna leave it alone for now. Yikes
7/27/16, 8:26:20 AM: Kim Alexanderson: That is a bit scary...üò±
7/27/16, 8:27:41 AM: Tuan Phan: If I superimpose his face on a Pikachu, it'd probably go through
7/27/16, 8:27:58 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Maybe next week you should test your theory - fancy dress as the great uncle and try to post that..!!
7/27/16, 8:28:15 AM: Tuan Phan: Hahaha
7/27/16, 9:30:51 PM: Luisa Zhou: Happy birthday Yinger!
7/27/16, 9:30:52 PM: Anton Delcamp: Some mainstream media in France decided the past few days to stop showing terrorists ID photo and some even the names. Let's hope it spreads globally. Still, some tv channels announced keeping broadcasting pictures and names. I hope they'll fall in line with the others.
7/27/16, 9:31:58 PM: Anton Delcamp: Bad timing for my more serious topic, but yeah, happy birthday Ying!!

9/8/16, 1:25:44 AM: Mike Ying: Is there pickup at sys on saturday 430-6? Thought i aaw something but cant find it anymore
9/8/16, 1:29:25 AM: Jason Cancel: It was cancelled because THT closed the fields because of excessive rain. The fields are in the process of growing new grass but all the rain has delay that.
9/8/16, 1:37:35 AM: Mike Ying: So no pickup at sys?
9/8/16, 1:45:02 AM: Tommy Fung: No pick up this weekend
9/8/16, 1:46:13 AM: Tommy Fung: There will be more sessions and training opportunities for non club players after pan asia
9/8/16, 2:19:06 AM: Mike Ying: Cool thanks
9/8/16, 7:34:17 PM: Donna Gee: Big favour needed: does anyone have any experience with having to fly a long distance after surgery and know about the risks of clotting? My colleague is stuck in the UK and apparently nhs are saying her risk of clotting if travelling within 3 months after surgery is high. And it's higher for her because she had two surgeries in the last 2 months. Any advice out there????
9/8/16, 7:35:55 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: the airlines are strict - usually erring far on the side of caution (rightly so...)
9/8/16, 7:36:10 PM: Donna Gee: 2nd favour... Anyone who would be able to teach lower school food technology!!! Cake making techniques and savoury snacks unit.
9/8/16, 7:36:22 PM: Tuan Phan: Ooh I had the same advice. There are compression stuff you can wear but I played it safe and didn't go anywhere for a bit immediately after my ACL surgery
9/8/16, 7:36:22 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: If they are aware, they would need certs
9/8/16, 7:36:49 PM: Donna Gee: Thanks peeps. How long tuan?
9/8/16, 7:36:58 PM: Donna Gee: Approximately.
9/8/16, 7:37:05 PM: Donna Gee: Her cast is off now.
9/8/16, 7:37:20 PM: Donna Gee: So I think it's been 6-8 weeks.
9/8/16, 7:37:32 PM: Donna Gee: But yeah nhs doctors are saying 3 months
9/8/16, 7:39:55 PM: Tuan Phan: I vaguely remember flying 3, 4 months out and getting advice from my doc/physio. He okd it and said I could wear compression stuff if I wanted to. I ultimately did wear them but not on return
9/8/16, 7:40:39 PM: Tuan Phan: But I don't think it was a super long flight like back to the states though , and it was my first and very successful surgery. I'm with will, err on safety
9/8/16, 7:41:11 PM: Donna Gee: Thanks
9/8/16, 8:29:47 PM: Tim Dodwell: Doona, best advice is get a doctors clearance to fly. The airlines will want to see this. Advice the doctor that you will be flying and his recommendations.
9/8/16, 9:44:02 PM: Sam Axelrod: Yeah I was told 3-4 months.  They put me on  blood thinners for my flight back here from sing after the surgery
9/8/16, 10:57:13 PM: Donna Gee: Thanks so much everyone
9/10/16, 10:02:49 PM: Jenna B: Faster to walk from east TST -> star ferry -> pier 9
Or take MTR to Nam Cheung -> HK station and walk to Pier 9
‚Ä¶? ü§î anyone?
9/10/16, 10:03:38 PM: Mike Ying: For you, probably to nam cheong....
9/10/16, 10:03:44 PM: Karen Mok: About the same haha
9/10/16, 10:04:25 PM: Mike Ying: The pier is at least 5 minute walk from HK station
9/10/16, 10:04:55 PM: Karen Mok: East TST to pier is about 5 mins walk too so same lol
9/10/16, 10:05:04 PM: Jenna B: Hahaha
9/10/16, 10:05:05 PM: Jenna B: Ok.
9/10/16, 10:05:10 PM: Jenna B: So thanks for nothing.

9/10/16, 10:06:25 PM: Mike Ying: Yeah but mtr is faster than ferry and the walk from east tst to the ferry is much longer than 5 minutes
9/10/16, 10:06:50 PM: Kingi Lau: With JB's long legs, 5 mins is enough for her to walk to the pier from hk station
9/10/16, 10:06:57 PM: Mike Ying: Yes!
9/10/16, 10:07:17 PM: Jenna B: Challenge accepted! 4 min!!!
9/10/16, 10:15:08 PM: Conor Quigley: East TST is a long way from ferry pier. 15-20 mins. HK station is much closer.
9/10/16, 10:19:53 PM: Jason Cancel: While the star ferry is always a nice ride (ask holly), the mtr is much more quantifiable and predictable in scheduling journey duration.
9/10/16, 11:57:40 PM: Mike Ying: Cals contribution to the party

9/11/16, 1:17:22 PM: Tuan Phan: I fully expect the next pics Karen send to be blurries of Hkupa people having awkward sex on the boat. Scandals!
9/11/16, 6:53:27 PM: Kim Alexanderson: Anyone have a good Physio (chiropractor) you can recommend?

9/24/16, 10:07:47 PM: Nick Tsao: Not sure... Atleast all the restaurants will still be running
9/24/16, 10:09:13 PM: Clay Carol: So not like a street fair with food vendors ?
9/24/16, 10:09:35 PM: Clay Carol: Ok I'll text when I'm there
9/24/16, 10:30:59 PM: Nick Tsao: Might be food vendors

9/25/16, 12:39:33 AM: Nick Tsao: <‚Äéimage omitted>
9/25/16, 12:55:25 AM: Nicole Alpert: Cool. Maybe we'll see you guys later? Going to be there at 2
9/25/16, 12:57:08 AM: Anton Delcamp: There is a spot where you can give your opinion on the "fences between the activities and the tram". Might be useful if they repeat the event.
9/25/16, 1:11:31 AM: Nick Tsao: Yea. The tram thing doesnt seem well handled...
9/25/16, 1:22:15 AM: Anton Delcamp: Well, tram among pedestrians at very slow speed works well at the north point market but here, I understand the concerns if many kids run around. Still, I'd definitely prefer the event taking the full width.
9/25/16, 1:23:21 AM: Clay Carol: <‚Äéimage omitted>

10/9/16, 9:12:24 PM: Clay Carol: TKO by Anderson
10/9/16, 9:19:02 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Cory Doctorow's trump sniff counter on twitter is up to 29
10/9/16, 9:23:36 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: 'Trump is making some good points that could hurt Bill Clinton's chances to be elected president in 1992'
10/9/16, 9:24:01 PM: Wanda Yuen: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
10/9/16, 9:24:10 PM: Tuan Phan: Zing! Burnage!
10/9/16, 9:29:50 PM: Wanda Yuen: He's whining!
10/9/16, 9:30:10 PM: Tuan Phan: Trump is on drugs man. Seriously. This is just... so embarrassing
10/9/16, 9:33:46 PM: Wanda Yuen: He doesn't look stable..
10/9/16, 9:44:10 PM: Wanda Yuen: I am taking mini van from Mongkok straight to Sai Kung. At exactly where we are meeting again?
10/9/16, 10:07:39 PM: Clay Carol: His favorite wakes is 'disaster' followed by a sniff
10/9/16, 10:10:13 PM: Grant Franke: Apparently Trump and his running mate Pence are on different platforms regarding war and Russia. That's comforting
10/9/16, 10:10:30 PM: Grant Franke: "We haven't talked"
10/9/16, 10:11:54 PM: Wanda Yuen: Left early for hiking
So the debate is just over?
10/9/16, 10:15:42 PM: Tuan Phan: A black dude asked a question and he went directly to what he'd do for the inner cities... hahaha
10/9/16, 10:16:19 PM: Nicole Alpert: Lol
10/9/16, 10:16:34 PM: Nicole Alpert: üòÇ but really üò¢
10/9/16, 10:18:45 PM: Tuan Phan: I gotta say Hillary's getting gifts here and she's been... underwhelming... I already miss Obama. I don't care about why trump is bad- inspire me a bit, geez
10/9/16, 10:22:40 PM: CAL: Trump just bragged about his number of twitter and Facebook followers
10/9/16, 10:23:52 PM: Grant Franke: I wish Hillary would simply say that Trump's repeated interruptions are a clear example of his lack of discipline
10/9/16, 10:24:35 PM: CAL: Hillary can definitely be hitting Donald harder and treating him less seriously
10/9/16, 10:27:51 PM: Tuan Phan: I met three middle aged Vietnamese Americans who are trump supporters this month - apparently well to do asian ams, Chinese and Vietnamese, are quite into trump here in Boston... let's just say it's beyond exhausting talking to them
10/9/16, 10:39:49 PM: Grant Franke: Ugh
10/9/16, 10:41:04 PM: Kristin Franke: https://twitter.com/funder/status/785292939647934465
10/9/16, 10:52:40 PM: CAL: Do you think that's real?
10/9/16, 10:53:03 PM: Clay Carol: Not real - fox just read a tweet from pence saying trump did great
10/9/16, 10:53:11 PM: Clay Carol: And yes, I'm watching FOX news !
10/9/16, 10:58:38 PM: Nicole Alpert: I wonder how real his threat is to throw his political opponent in jail.
10/9/16, 10:59:57 PM: Jak Lau: As real as everything else he says
10/9/16, 11:01:08 PM: Nicole Alpert: As real as this hair...that should be one of his new zingers.
10/9/16, 11:05:19 PM: Jason Cancel: Sincere question: for those watching and commenting on the debate, is there anything the 2 losers could say that would sway your opinion of who you're going to vote for (or would vote if you could for the non-Americans like Wanda and Tuan)?
10/9/16, 11:05:51 PM: Kristin Franke: At this point no.
10/9/16, 11:07:00 PM: Tuan Phan: You're kidding bout me not voting yah? Actually not sure how I can vote since I'm back in Hong Kong nov 6, though I've registered and all that
10/9/16, 11:07:06 PM: Tommy Fung: I thought Tuan is an American l
10/9/16, 11:07:45 PM: Jason Cancel: Ok, the Tuan but was a joke, but sincere about the question posed
10/9/16, 11:08:37 PM: Tuan Phan: I'd be voting for mass... which even w all the succEssful Vietnamese Americans (smh sadly) will never go trump
10/9/16, 11:08:44 PM: Tuan Phan: Massachusetts I mean
10/9/16, 11:11:41 PM: Grant Franke: üò¢ üá∫üá∏
10/9/16, 11:19:54 PM: Nicole Alpert: Yes I think so, Jason. Issue for all living abroad is that they won't get as much time to consider. Need to send the ballot in a week or two before.
10/9/16, 11:20:44 PM: Nicole Alpert: What's Mi looking like Grant and Kristin?
10/9/16, 11:26:32 PM: CAL: Some debates in the past have been illuminating but no at this point I'm watching just for sadistic reasons
10/9/16, 11:27:40 PM: Neil Gysel: U S and Eh!  U S and Eh!  U S and Eh!
10/9/16, 11:37:50 PM: Clay Carol: If trump wins I think one of the walls will be paid for by Canada
10/9/16, 11:38:16 PM: Jason Cancel: üòÜ
10/10/16, 12:06:44 AM: Grant Franke: I think Michigan is up in the air. Torn between Detroit and the rest of the state
10/10/16, 12:12:52 AM: Sam Axelrod: <‚Äéimage omitted>
10/10/16, 12:20:01 AM: Nicole Alpert: Why only 4 out of 5 stars!
10/10/16, 12:28:05 AM: Tuan Phan: I don't know, Sam. The debate made me feel nauseous and gassy and constipated, but unable to poop or fart or throw up and thus in this limbo land of deep existential pain.
10/10/16, 12:29:34 AM: Nicole Alpert: Try burping.
10/10/16, 10:27:44 AM: Clay Carol: Think I found my calling

10/14/16, 1:52:45 AM: Mike Ying: You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time. Could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot, second chances

Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body, oh
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know-oh-oh, that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

10/26/16, 11:11:59 AM: Tuan Phan: Anyway, the name always kind of cracks me up a little. But it's true - gender is a construct.

I missed the last year one cuz I was running AOUC, but in other years I always invite a bunch of Frisbee friends, Christians or not. One pic on one year's banquet: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=570972494789&set=t.589454210&type=3&theater Ticket at HK$250 each cuz it's a fund raising banquet - all funds to support youth mission trips. In the past years we've been building houses in Manila with Kids International Missionary (KIM). There would also be auctions, but overall it's a banquet with lovely food and youths serving you. Let me know if you can come and I can buy tickets for you. Welcome to invite your significant others too :) So far Jenna and I are in

11/2/16, 11:48:33 PM: Jason Cancel: You know, from a non-sports perspective, it's probably best that Cleveland wins because in the inevitable celebrations, rioting and looting that follows, it doesn't really matter it they destroy Cleveland. It's not like we really need that "city"

11/3/16, 12:52:38 AM: Clay Carol: Two observations
11/3/16, 12:53:02 AM: Clay Carol: 1) there seemed to be a lot of Cubs fans in Cleveland.
11/3/16, 12:53:12 AM: Anton Delcamp: What. A. Game. My first full in live. Not disappointed. üòÑ
I finished on the radio and on that last hit, with the excitement of the broadcaster, I thought the runner was coming for a score.

11/8/16, 9:35:20 PM: CAL: I don't know wtf is happening
11/8/16, 9:35:24 PM: Jason Cancel: C'mon people, you didn't see this coming?! Duterte, Park Geun-hye, Brexit, Cubs.... Trump was almost a certainty
11/8/16, 9:35:28 PM: Quentin Kwong: Fuckkkk
11/8/16, 9:35:43 PM: Wanda Yuen: No way!!!
11/8/16, 9:38:35 PM: Tuan Phan: So far 40% of American women have voted for Trump. That's just... no words
11/8/16, 9:39:48 PM: Wanda Yuen: well, a lot of less educated white women are for Trump. but they make up 40% of all American women?!
11/8/16, 9:42:43 PM: Nicole Alpert: Is it? I thought Trump supporters were pretty avg in education and salary. Good point Jason. I've money on HRC so she better trump that bitxh
11/8/16, 9:50:53 PM: Clay Carol: Looked like trumpistan
11/8/16, 9:53:04 PM: Anton Delcamp: I'm still overly confident but if FL and NC go for him, it'll be tight.
11/8/16, 9:54:54 PM: Nicole Alpert: So am I Antonin, although I think it's so I stop drinking more this morning.
11/8/16, 9:57:23 PM: Tim Orourke: FL, OH, MI - winner needs 2 of those states. All 3 now trump is leading
11/8/16, 9:58:55 PM: Sam Axelrod: <‚Äéimage omitted>
11/8/16, 9:59:49 PM: Anton Delcamp: Trump might have a bit of cold sweat right now and be like "fuck, I might win that thing".
11/8/16, 10:01:34 PM: Nicole Alpert: If we get Trump in office, I think we should get X-Men and Batman too. Just saying. Both were as unbelievable (except as Jason says people love them some populism)
11/8/16, 10:15:36 PM: Anton Delcamp: Tight lead in VA. But FL and OH seem gone.
11/8/16, 10:16:06 PM: Wanda Yuen: you mean Trump taking them?
11/8/16, 10:16:11 PM: Anton Delcamp: Yes
11/8/16, 10:16:25 PM: Tim Orourke: Means it's over

11/8/16, 10:17:50 PM: Clay Carol: Will come down to NH, NC, Michigan
11/8/16, 10:18:00 PM: Clay Carol: vA looks Hillary
11/8/16, 10:18:28 PM: Tim Orourke: Hillary cannot win now without Florida
11/8/16, 10:19:36 PM: Tim Dodwell: This is nuts...I wonder if trump cleans out clinton with a landslide. So crazy
11/8/16, 10:20:28 PM: Tuan Phan: I was just in NH driving my bro around. 9 out of 10 signs were trump pence
11/8/16, 10:21:01 PM: Wanda Yuen: this world is no longer sane...

11/8/16, 10:39:01 PM: Anton Delcamp: 538 still puts Clinton at 52% chance of winning (as of now). She was at 72% 1h30 ago and 44% 15 min ago.
11/8/16, 10:40:07 PM: Tommy Fung: VA to Clinton
11/8/16, 10:40:11 PM: Holly McHugh: I'm drinking
11/8/16, 10:40:40 PM: CAL: VA is huge. If she lost that...
11/8/16, 10:40:57 PM: Neil Gysel: *yuge
11/8/16, 10:41:15 PM: Sam Axelrod: She got VA
11/8/16, 10:41:24 PM: Anton Delcamp: VA was called
11/8/16, 10:41:50 PM: CAL: How the fuck is she losing Wisconsin and Michigan
11/8/16, 10:42:30 PM: Anton Delcamp: Wisconsin too close to call 20 min ago.
11/8/16, 10:42:51 PM: Anton Delcamp: Same for Michigan 30 min ago
11/8/16, 10:43:09 PM: Tommy Fung: Trump had a good strategy in Michigan
11/8/16, 10:43:11 PM: Kristin Franke: He's up 2% right now in Wisconsin. Didn't see how much is counted

11/8/16, 10:47:53 PM: Anton Delcamp: Current chance of winning: Clinton 50%, Trump 48%
11/8/16, 10:48:48 PM: Neil Gysel: "he won't make it to the debates"
11/8/16, 10:49:34 PM: Anton Delcamp: Chance of controlling senate: Republicans 80%, Dem 20%
11/8/16, 10:52:20 PM: Tim Dodwell: Donald has got all those people who have never come out to vote to come out and do so.
11/8/16, 10:53:01 PM: Jak Lau: The whole systems rigged!

11/8/16, 10:55:42 PM: CAL: I mean what currency is left to feel confident in
11/8/16, 10:55:43 PM: Ruth Chen: No one is working right now. Everyone's freaking out in the office
11/8/16, 10:56:00 PM: Sam Axelrod: Stock futures are down 600 already
11/8/16, 10:56:53 PM: Tuan Phan: There is exactly 0 percent chance this ends well. If Hillary wins it's contentious and violent. If trump wins it's fucking end of the world. We're all fucked.
11/8/16, 10:57:42 PM: Tuan Phan: But the Boston Celtics look like they have a good team this year
11/8/16, 11:00:36 PM: Jason Cancel: Glad to have you on board, Tuan. No matter who wins, America loses.
11/8/16, 11:01:07 PM: Tim Orourke: It's a good day for white trash
11/8/16, 11:01:09 PM: Anton Delcamp: The US system of winner-take-call in most states is unfair, but he's also leading the national vote in numbers... üòê
11/8/16, 11:01:44 PM: Tim Orourke: Party at my trailer park, bring white hoods
11/8/16, 11:02:25 PM: Jenna B: *nervous chuckle - so true.
11/8/16, 11:03:43 PM: Anton Delcamp: 0% reported yet CA announced for Clinton. Of course.
11/8/16, 11:04:09 PM: CAL: Sell sell sell
11/8/16, 11:05:28 PM: CAL: How's the political future in Vietnam?
11/8/16, 11:05:41 PM: Sam Axelrod: TUAN 2020
11/8/16, 11:06:18 PM: Tuan Phan: With 99.9% of the population voting, all for one party, the communist party wins in Vietnam
11/8/16, 11:06:20 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Tuan/Kanye 2020
11/8/16, 11:06:28 PM: Wanda Yuen: You know to NOT consider HK, where you have China to interpret the law for you, proactively

11/8/16, 11:16:40 PM: Tommy Fung: michigan and wisconsin will decide America's future
11/8/16, 11:17:17 PM: Jenna B: Working election night must be a statistician's dream‚Ä¶ üòç
11/8/16, 11:17:35 PM: CAL: As a statistician, I'm gonna say, no
11/8/16, 11:17:39 PM: Tommy Fung: they do get paid a lot for it haha
11/8/16, 11:18:01 PM: Jenna B: Hahhaa
11/8/16, 11:19:34 PM: CAL: It's all automated anyway. You write a script one time and just feed in real time data
11/8/16, 11:23:29 PM: Nick Tsao: Err. Why is washington pink..?
11/8/16, 11:24:21 PM: Charis Poon: lighter colors means unconfirmed
11/8/16, 11:24:27 PM: Tuan Phan: It's so sad how trump is gonna screw the people who voted for him as well as people who didn't
11/8/16, 11:24:40 PM: Anton Delcamp: MI tight again. 0.6% difference
11/8/16, 11:24:59 PM: Anton Delcamp: 60% reported
11/8/16, 11:30:07 PM: Quentin Kwong: Canada‚Äôs immigration website has crashed multiple times, according to news reports (it was very slow for this reporter).

Officials do not appear to have addressed why the website is crashing ‚Äì no updates appeared on Canadian immigration officials‚Äô social media ‚Äì but many election watchers presumed traffic is slowing the site down following Trump‚Äôs lead in electoral votes.
11/8/16, 11:31:28 PM: Neil Gysel: So looking for a positive in every situation..  Clay will bringing his annual HK Halloween party back to life.  He's currently working on flight to move back to HK!!

Can this still happen?... please?
11/8/16, 11:36:21 PM: Anton Delcamp: It would be worse
11/8/16, 11:36:46 PM: Anton Delcamp: Proof for some that it's rigged
11/8/16, 11:37:18 PM: Anton Delcamp: Especially if trump actually win national popular vote
11/8/16, 11:40:12 PM: Clay Carol: It's not rigged
11/8/16, 11:40:16 PM: Clay Carol: She lost
11/8/16, 11:43:59 PM: Sam Axelrod: Yup
11/8/16, 11:44:01 PM: Sam Axelrod: It's over
11/8/16, 11:44:10 PM: CAL: I just left a party in the most liberal part of America. There were balloons and shit ready
11/8/16, 11:50:00 PM: Nicole Alpert: It's not rigged!! Thank goodness.
11/8/16, 11:50:12 PM: Anton Delcamp: 538 chances: 20-78 üòü
11/8/16, 11:51:14 PM: Nicole Alpert: Man he really bet his reputation on this.
11/8/16, 11:51:21 PM: Nicole Alpert: Was opposite a few hours ago
11/8/16, 11:51:27 PM: Nicole Alpert: They removed it from the site
11/8/16, 11:53:15 PM: Nicole Alpert: Wonder if white people are going to be told to have more babies now.
11/9/16, 12:01:07 AM: Nicole Alpert: I love that China can now be like, see? You want this for yourselves? Say no to democracy
11/9/16, 12:08:14 AM: Clay Carol: Canadian immigration website has crashed
11/9/16, 12:13:25 AM: CAL: Good night. I'm out. Nothing to live for
11/9/16, 12:14:03 AM: Nicole Alpert: Cal you can have the couch but have to help walk dogs :)
11/9/16, 12:20:14 AM: CAL: Not gonna even set my alarm
11/9/16, 12:26:52 AM: Jenna B: I'm going to drink my sorrows away tonight at Oktoberfest. This is‚Ä¶ unfathomable...
11/9/16, 12:38:26 AM: Neil Gysel: Remember all those Canada jokes Cal!
11/9/16, 12:41:26 AM: Ed Lee: Axelrod was big on those too

11/9/16, 1:16:33 AM: Holly McHugh: The real winner today is alcoholism
11/9/16, 1:17:21 AM: Quentin Kwong: <‚Äéimage omitted>

11/9/16, 2:39:06 AM: Neil Gysel: Who you watching / reading?
11/9/16, 2:39:37 AM: Anton Delcamp: Npr and 538
11/9/16, 2:40:11 AM: Neil Gysel: I find most people are cautious to call it just yet..  Not even Fox has called it?
11/9/16, 2:40:39 AM: Tommy Fung: USA Today and Guardian called it already
11/9/16, 2:40:46 AM: Tommy Fung: CNN just said Clinton conceded
11/9/16, 2:41:12 AM: Neil Gysel: I got nbc on now...
11/9/16, 2:41:21 AM: Neil Gysel: Fox just called it.
11/9/16, 2:42:19 AM: Neil Gysel: Wow..  She called Trump!  I didn't think she would go down that easy.
11/9/16, 2:42:46 AM: Lincoln Cheung: USA USA USA
11/9/16, 2:43:05 AM: Neil Gysel: üî•
11/9/16, 2:43:10 AM: Tommy Fung: she basically lost every swing state, it wasnt even close
11/9/16, 2:43:15 AM: Anton Delcamp: It's not down to one state. Too many went the other way. Hard to argue.
11/9/16, 2:43:43 AM: Tommy Fung: the opposite basically happened to what everybody predicted
11/9/16, 2:44:19 AM: Anton Delcamp: Statistical models will be redefined after today.
11/9/16, 2:45:40 AM: Neil Gysel: "Vice president elect"

11/9/16, 2:46:05 AM: Quentin Kwong: First Lady !
11/9/16, 2:46:09 AM: Quentin Kwong: Argh !
11/9/16, 2:46:10 AM: Tuan Phan: I hope all the women he's clutched and sexually mistreated press charges and he spends his first term in court for all the shit he's pulled. Unfucking believable
11/9/16, 2:46:54 AM: Anton Delcamp: France did the naked first lady first!
11/9/16, 2:47:06 AM: Quentin Kwong: Oh yeah !
11/9/16, 2:56:35 AM: Anton Delcamp: Victory speech now
11/9/16, 3:08:33 AM: Anton Delcamp: Well, Obama's in 2008 was "a bit" more inspiring. As usual, no content. Trump must be disappointed he didn't get to use "disgrace/disgraceful" this time.
11/9/16, 3:20:24 AM: Tuan Phan: I'd like to add that we have a Vice President who actively endorses sending gay people to camps to get reformed into "straightness." Let's not even get into climate change, which is officially fubar.
11/9/16, 3:26:26 AM: Nick Tsao: How many years do you think this puts humanity/technology back by? 4 years downhill + 6 years recovery= 10 year of stagnation?
11/9/16, 3:37:00 AM: Holly McHugh: Yes Tuan, my biracial kids are terrified, two of my kids are gay... all of my kids think they're aren't part of this America
11/9/16, 3:37:11 AM: Holly McHugh: I'm so fucking angry
11/9/16, 3:37:37 AM: Holly McHugh: And yeah... maybe this isn't super 'party'... sorry
11/9/16, 3:40:50 AM: Tuan Phan: Yeah if more people were angry on our side, about the crap he did and said, and went out to vote, we'd have won this election. Im so angry. I know what kind of America's out there now. Yeah It's the apocalypse, may it be short and may it bring the actual end of these hateful people. If nothing else, demographics will skew increasingly away from them.
11/9/16, 3:41:09 AM: Tuan Phan: Bring your kids to settle in Michigan in two years ;)
11/9/16, 3:41:51 AM: Tommy Fung: maybe that's what people care about Tuan.
11/9/16, 3:41:59 AM: Tommy Fung: they care about losing jobs
11/9/16, 3:42:49 AM: Tommy Fung: not saying Trump is good for jobs. but when you're not going anywhere with your life, change is better than no change.
11/9/16, 3:43:05 AM: Tommy Fung: it's incredibly difficult for a party to hold 3 terms
11/9/16, 3:43:22 AM: Jak Lau: Comedians are gonna have loads of material.
11/9/16, 3:43:25 AM: Tommy Fung: in fact, democrats have never held 3 terms
11/9/16, 3:44:03 AM: Tommy Fung: also, i meant to say maybe that's not what people care about. scandals are...white noise
11/9/16, 3:47:04 AM: Anton Delcamp: We think of the political world as being the views of new York, London, Paris... But recent national results prove that the country think differently from those cities. See trump, see brexit, and the push of the extreme right in France.
11/9/16, 3:47:31 AM: Holly McHugh: Exactly. And I find it terrifying
11/9/16, 3:48:55 AM: Anton Delcamp: Well, it's democracy, whether we like the results or not.
11/9/16, 3:50:17 AM: Tim Orourke: Trump's trial next month for raping that 13 year old should be interesting
11/9/16, 3:51:24 AM: Tommy Fung: she dropped the suit already
11/9/16, 3:51:56 AM: Tuan Phan: It's a push back against a general trend towards diversity and inclusiveness, is my hope. But I also do think the refugee story and terrorism plays so well in supporting the push back. The economics support tommy's point - and I just can't fathom they'd put their faith in billionaire trump of all people, but there it is
11/9/16, 4:09:47 AM: Lewis Glover: @jak Comedians arent going to be better off. The won't be able to make trumps decisions more humorous.
11/9/16, 4:10:14 AM: Sam Axelrod: I'm. Eating America
11/9/16, 4:10:14 AM: Sam Axelrod: <‚Äéimage omitted>
11/9/16, 4:20:16 AM: Eric Scott: Well, if it makes the Americans in the group feel any better about our country, legco once again failed to make it through a whole meeting today.
11/9/16, 5:21:07 AM: CAL: Sam. He's your boss now.
11/9/16, 5:21:22 AM: CAL: He'll probably pick a Secretary of State without a passport
11/9/16, 5:21:45 AM: Tuan Phan: He's in a tough spot right now. Just be careful what you say to him, lol
11/9/16, 5:31:40 AM: Jason Cancel: Comney for Sec of State
11/9/16, 5:32:05 AM: Sam Axelrod: Tuan is just happy as I let him win a game of basketball
11/9/16, 5:32:46 AM: Conor Quigley: Isn't Trump gonna feel the cabinet with winners of The Apprentice? Wasn't that the point of the show?
11/9/16, 5:33:07 AM: Sam Axelrod: ..... This is reason number 4000 why I left the states
11/9/16, 5:33:11 AM: Sam Axelrod: I hate reality shows
11/9/16, 5:43:51 AM: Neil Gysel: üôÄ

11/9/16, 6:24:52 AM: Sam Axelrod: But it's a purchase you will never regret!
11/9/16, 6:27:29 AM: Tim Dodwell: A good drop
11/9/16, 7:07:25 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Only one small drop to spare though
11/9/16, 11:03:16 AM: CAL: My coworkers look unaffected. I fear their allegiance
11/9/16, 11:03:53 AM: Holly McHugh: I really hoped that for one day we would change the group name to Party In My Pantsuit
11/9/16, 11:03:53 AM: Sam Axelrod: Sweep the knee
11/9/16, 11:04:56 AM: Wanda Yuen: I am still with pantsuit!
11/9/16, 11:05:20 AM: Sam Axelrod: Thanks Wanda

11/22/16, 1:47:09 AM: Eric Scott: Hey guys, I don't know if any of you have ever heard of ebenezer school, but it's the only school specifically aimed at teaching blind people and preparing them to transition to a normal life in all of hk. On December 11, they're hosting a blind walk (where you wear a blindfold and get led on a walk by a blind person and possibly a guide dog) as a fundraiser. My church meets at the school, and we're trying to support them as much as we can in the fundraiser by raising awareness about it. If anyone is interested in joining for the walk, this could be a fun chance to support a great charity that's doing some really important work in hk. And pets are welcome! Details are available at: http://www.watermarkchurch.hk/events/walk-with-pride
11/22/16, 2:24:52 AM: Lincoln Cheung: It's the only blind school in HK !!

1/10/17, 10:33:57 PM: Tim Dodwell: One good thing is that it shows where everyone is on the field when plays are happening. Good for play breakdown and strategy.

1/11/17, 12:39:22 AM: Tim Dodwell: Will try and capture a few more.  And get a little closer. 

That's if people don't mind a small drone flying overhead getting some good shots. 

I'm still getting used to it so it will be a learning experience for everyone. I'll try not to interfere in the game itself.
1/11/17, 12:40:28 AM: Nicole Alpert: 'try' lol
1/11/17, 12:41:04 AM: Tim Dodwell: Except when I'm playing üòú
1/11/17, 12:42:10 AM: Jak Lau: Yeah, was totally interfering with my d on josh. Slowed me down.
1/11/17, 12:42:31 AM: Donna Gee: Yeah and it affected the air movement of my hammer
1/11/17, 12:42:47 AM: Tim Dodwell: You were faster than the drone running the length of the field.... we should have a race...
1/11/17, 12:47:49 AM: Sam Axelrod: How much flight time so you get Tim?
1/11/17, 12:47:50 AM: Sam Axelrod: *do
1/11/17, 12:48:24 AM: Tim Dodwell: It was about 25 mins last night.
1/11/17, 12:48:50 AM: Tim Dodwell: But following Jak and doona, about 5 mins because they move too fast
1/11/17, 12:49:14 AM: Tim Dodwell: Following Tim and myself... all night long.... haha
1/11/17, 1:09:59 AM: Wanda Yuen: You sure you are remote controlling a drone and not a Boeing?
1/11/17, 2:14:34 AM: Nicole Alpert: A hahaha flying after jak and doona. That's about how long I can defend. üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄüèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄ

1/18/17, 11:07:12 PM: Wanda Yuen: @85266262234 I saw a similar venting machine in my old company before. That machine eats your $ and forces you to pay once more in order to push the food down to the tray

2/5/17, 7:57:44 PM: Clay Carol: Up the middle
2/5/17, 7:57:50 PM: Clay Carol: That's how the Giants did it
2/5/17, 7:57:51 PM: Clay Carol: 2x
2/5/17, 7:58:52 PM: Tuan Phan: O line getting shredded and they can't run the ball either
2/5/17, 7:58:59 PM: Tuan Phan: Predictable offense
2/5/17, 8:01:54 PM: Chris Harrison: I think bradys jilted with the falcons getting at him.
2/5/17, 8:04:06 PM: CAL: The only thing that can make this any worse is another executive order
2/5/17, 8:06:10 PM: Mike Ying: Worse? This is AWESOME.
2/5/17, 8:07:13 PM: Mike Ying: Had a good convo with my roommate about whether or not tom resents gisele's blackness
2/5/17, 8:10:37 PM: Neil Gysel: üôÖüèø‚Äç‚ôÇ
2/5/17, 8:25:05 PM: Tuan Phan: I think lady gagas great but I wish she'd have a dancing shark
2/5/17, 8:26:52 PM: JV Gortney: Where did she jump to...
2/5/17, 8:27:15 PM: Mike Ying: Hahahaha yeah what is it with gaga jumping off stuff
2/5/17, 8:27:51 PM: Steve Man: That was one of the better halftime shows in awhile
2/5/17, 8:30:54 PM: Tuan Phan: I think the choreography's really good. Good levels and use of lights
2/5/17, 8:47:16 PM: Charlotte Poon: cal stopped talking to me when i said the pats currently looked like the underdogs
2/5/17, 8:52:32 PM: Charis Poon: But everybody loves an underdog
2/5/17, 8:53:15 PM: Clay Carol: Brady is struggling with the inflated balls
2/5/17, 8:54:12 PM: Clay Carol: Bellichek uncomfortable without hoody
2/5/17, 9:05:38 PM: Mike Ying: Lol they cant throw the football becaus tom is still winded from running 7 yards
2/5/17, 9:06:33 PM: Mike Ying: <‚Äéaudio omitted>
2/5/17, 9:07:34 PM: Mike Ying: That was for the missed xp.
2/5/17, 9:09:06 PM: Clay Carol: I want Elton John to go sit with Mike Pence
2/5/17, 9:09:32 PM: Clay Carol: #whycantweallgetalong
2/5/17, 9:11:18 PM: Mike Ying: Loving pats special right now
2/5/17, 9:30:31 PM: Mike Ying: Lol dear joe buck, if a team has to score 16 points in a football game that is at least a 4, not 2, score game. #professionals
2/5/17, 9:32:09 PM: Steve Man: Huh? Two touchdowns with two 2-pt conversions to tie it up
2/5/17, 9:32:32 PM: Mike Ying: Is 4 scores...
2/5/17, 9:33:23 PM: Steve Man: Haha..I guess but if a team is down by seven, it's not a two score game...So at least they are consistent
2/5/17, 9:34:12 PM: Mike Ying: Yeah consistently terrible with spoken grammar.
2/5/17, 9:34:50 PM: Mike Ying: If a team is down by 7 they have to score a td AND an extra point. If they dont they lose.
2/5/17, 9:36:24 PM: Steve Man: that's true but the extra point or 2pt conversion is an automatic try. i see your point though
2/5/17, 9:38:00 PM: Clay Carol: I'll weight in
2/5/17, 9:38:30 PM: Clay Carol: The have traditionally looked at 7 points as 'one score'
2/5/17, 9:38:47 PM: Clay Carol: As the extra point is (was) around 90%
2/5/17, 9:39:25 PM: Clay Carol: 2 TD and 2, 2point conversions
2/5/17, 9:39:53 PM: Clay Carol: Is a lot more difficult than 'two scores' implies
2/5/17, 9:40:06 PM: Mike Ying: Pretty sure the word "score" as a noun means "have to do something to score points."
2/5/17, 9:40:46 PM: Tommy Fung: We need to talk more about the 3rd and 1 call then the grammar of NFL right now
2/5/17, 9:41:37 PM: Clay Carol: Here it is
2/5/17, 9:41:42 PM: Clay Carol: The two pointer
2/5/17, 9:41:53 PM: Mike Ying: Here we go three more scores! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2/5/17, 9:42:30 PM: CAL: Two!!
2/5/17, 9:43:14 PM: Clay Carol: Now the Massholes are all fired up
2/5/17, 9:43:50 PM: Jason Cancel: üòÇ
2/5/17, 9:44:21 PM: Mike Ying: This year's superbowl and its commercials are brought to by 'member berries.
2/5/17, 9:44:55 PM: Tuan Phan: Whoop whoop!
2/5/17, 9:45:31 PM: Mike Ying: FUCK JOE BUCK
2/5/17, 9:45:52 PM: Tommy Fung: Why so angry
2/5/17, 9:46:29 PM: Tuan Phan: God that missed kick by gostkowski is huge right now. Come on dddd
2/5/17, 9:47:00 PM: Mike Ying: I hate commentators that cant be impartial
2/5/17, 9:47:09 PM: Mike Ying: You should hear him talk about the cardinals
2/5/17, 9:48:39 PM: Mike Ying: Damn julio
2/5/17, 9:48:45 PM: Steve Man: that's crazy catch by jones!
2/5/17, 9:49:07 PM: Clay Carol: This game
2/5/17, 9:49:09 PM: Clay Carol: That's
2/5/17, 9:49:32 PM: Mike Ying: These next 6 minutes will take 2 hours.
2/5/17, 9:52:30 PM: Tommy Fung: Why are they still throwing ....
2/5/17, 9:53:20 PM: Clay Carol: Can't put them away...
2/5/17, 9:53:31 PM: Clay Carol: They should have made 3 and this was over
2/5/17, 9:54:08 PM: Mike Ying: Probably the same thing that happens to russell wilson on 4th and 2nd to the goal....
2/5/17, 9:54:37 PM: Mike Ying: Aaaaaand the illuminati with the interception!
2/5/17, 9:55:10 PM: Mike Ying: *4th and 2
2/5/17, 9:55:24 PM: CAL: Nsurhagwfhsbhdhwhhs
2/5/17, 9:55:30 PM: Clay Carol: Brady getting banged up in the pocket
2/5/17, 9:56:07 PM: Mike Ying: "Seen chris hogan make a lot of these plays"
2/5/17, 9:56:32 PM: Mike Ying: Dang, really wanted to see that safety
2/5/17, 9:56:56 PM: Kristin Franke: Intentional grounding for a safety. Best kind
2/5/17, 9:59:07 PM: CAL: Omg
2/5/17, 9:59:13 PM: Kristin Franke: That's INSANE
2/5/17, 9:59:37 PM: Clay Carol: Camerawork
2/5/17, 9:59:55 PM: CAL: It's like the Kearse catch but we caught it
2/5/17, 9:59:58 PM: Mike Ying: Catch
2/5/17, 10:00:29 PM: Mike Ying: And what happened then cal?
2/5/17, 10:01:08 PM: Tommy Fung: That's like the helmut catch
2/5/17, 10:01:22 PM: CAL: You're the worst Ying
2/5/17, 10:01:31 PM: Charlotte Poon: üëÜüèº
2/5/17, 10:04:43 PM: Clay Carol: Who knew that missed PAT was so big
2/5/17, 10:04:58 PM: Clay Carol: I wasn't even paying attention then
2/5/17, 10:05:33 PM: Mike Ying: One more score!
2/5/17, 10:06:31 PM: CAL: Yeyysy yea yes yes yes yes
2/5/17, 10:06:39 PM: Mike Ying: Oh lord.
2/5/17, 10:06:58 PM: Chris Harrison: Flashes of november 4th
2/5/17, 10:07:43 PM: Tommy Fung: Wow
2/5/17, 10:07:45 PM: CAL: How about that two score game?
2/5/17, 10:07:48 PM: Clay Carol: I'm going to use the C word
2/5/17, 10:08:15 PM: Mike Ying: I'm gonna lose a lot of weight this year vomiting anytime i hear the words tom brady best qb ever.
2/5/17, 10:08:52 PM: CAL: GOAT
2/5/17, 10:08:54 PM: Tommy Fung: 57s, still enough time
2/5/17, 10:09:29 PM: JV Gortney: 0 TOs 
2/5/17, 10:09:41 PM: Kristin Franke: Here comes overtime
2/5/17, 10:10:38 PM: Tommy Fung: That pass on 3rd and 1, biggest mistake ever
2/5/17, 10:11:05 PM: Tommy Fung: That's almost as bad as the seahawks throwing it at the 2
2/5/17, 10:13:24 PM: CAL: The strip sack?
2/5/17, 10:13:55 PM: CAL: That was so weird!!
2/5/17, 10:14:36 PM: Tuan Phan: This game is siiiiiick!
2/5/17, 10:16:22 PM: Ed Lee: Really made up for that underwhelming first half
2/5/17, 10:16:26 PM: Clay Carol: Falcons choked
2/5/17, 10:16:31 PM: Clay Carol: Big time
2/5/17, 10:16:50 PM: Clay Carol: 19 points in 4Q in super bowl?
2/5/17, 10:16:54 PM: Clay Carol: Cmon
2/5/17, 10:17:21 PM: Clay Carol: Offense has fallen apart too except for that one Jones catch
2/5/17, 10:17:54 PM: Clay Carol: In other news I'm sitting next to a tranny while watching the game
2/5/17, 10:17:55 PM: Steve Man: i've been watching with my mom..she's been going crazy..it's been hilarious
2/5/17, 10:18:01 PM: Mike Ying: Im telling yall, it's the illuminati! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2/5/17, 10:20:02 PM: CAL: Putting the gag in Gaga
2/5/17, 10:21:52 PM: Jason Cancel: Clay, you're in bangkok, too?
2/5/17, 10:22:01 PM: Mike Ying: Steve, does your mom watch a lot of football? You should tell her tom bradys accomplishments are all the more impressive because he used to be a decent human being.
2/5/17, 10:22:03 PM: Tommy Fung: Falcons D is tired
2/5/17, 10:23:45 PM: Clay Carol: Yeah
2/5/17, 10:25:36 PM: CAL: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2/5/17, 10:27:06 PM: Tuan Phan: Holy crap that's gotta be the best comeback ever in super bowl history
2/5/17, 10:27:07 PM: Mike Ying: That was pretty close, in, but should have been reviewed. Celebrations went off so fast.
2/5/17, 10:27:31 PM: Kristin Franke: Brady retiring now?
2/5/17, 10:27:54 PM: Sam Axelrod: SUCK IT GODDELL
2/5/17, 10:27:56 PM: Clay Carol: No
2/5/17, 10:28:02 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Four More Years!
2/5/17, 10:28:02 PM: Sam Axelrod: FUCK YES
2/5/17, 10:28:51 PM: Clay Carol: Does anyone know the Heimlich maneuver ?
2/5/17, 10:31:53 PM: Steve Man: it's gonna be an awkward meeting between goodell and brady..
2/5/17, 10:31:58 PM: Tuan Phan: Hahaha
2/5/17, 10:40:50 PM: Tuan Phan: It seems to me that Tom Brady is the best quarterback to ever play the game... /waitsonying
2/5/17, 10:44:34 PM: CAL: This is so satisfying
2/5/17, 10:45:51 PM: Sam Axelrod: Un frickin real
2/5/17, 11:09:01 PM: Mike Ying: <‚Äéaudio omitted>
2/5/17, 11:34:19 PM: CAL: Ok that was actually really funny
2/5/17, 11:38:47 PM: Tuan Phan: There was apparently a dude who bet 1.1 mil on Atlanta to win or lose by 1 or 2 points. Can't imagine the rollercoaster ride he's going through. Suicide hotline should stay nearby
2/6/17, 11:55:20 AM: Jason Cancel: <‚Äéimage omitted>
2/6/17, 1:52:40 PM: Anton Delcamp: I just finished watching the game. Avoided media the whole day as usual. Despite a clever mute on this group, i saw a message preview for Tommy's "Falcons D is tired" and i thought i had a spoiler for a Patriot landslide. Pfffff. What a game. I follow the packers and didn't take a side in that game. Just wanted a good game to watch. Not disappointed! Short night ahead.

2/7/17, 2:08:59 AM: Jak Lau: Fishsticks?!
2/7/17, 2:09:07 AM: Will Munkara-Kerr: Fiddlesticks
2/7/17, 3:00:45 AM: JV Gortney: Anyone got tips for staying overnight in Manila airport?
2/7/17, 3:01:05 AM: Jason Cancel: Really?
2/7/17, 3:01:25 AM: Jak Lau: Stranger danger.
2/7/17, 3:01:33 AM: Jak Lau: No.1
2/7/17, 3:01:37 AM: Neil Gysel: Best tip is...  Don't.
2/7/17, 3:01:46 AM: Neil Gysel: Next best would be,  casino across the road?
2/7/17, 3:07:50 AM: Eric Scott: You can get a place to stay super cheap that's close to the airport. If you go for cheap, it won't be fancy, but at least you'll have a bed and a door
2/7/17, 3:08:30 AM: Wanda Yuen: No one in Manila that you can stay with?
2/7/17, 3:10:26 AM: Jak Lau: Doesn't D-Ram live in Manila? Or Lester is very friendly.
2/7/17, 3:37:17 AM: Rissa Ong: Theres a hotel right across
2/7/17, 3:37:22 AM: Rissa Ong: Remington i think is the name
2/7/17, 3:37:47 AM: Rissa Ong: Its right across the terminal where cathay and cebu pacific land
2/7/17, 3:51:25 AM: Wanda Yuen: JV you still alive?
2/7/17, 3:51:54 AM: JV Gortney: Yes -- looking for hotel vacancy. Thanks, all üôè
2/7/17, 3:52:11 AM: Wanda Yuen: I think Lester is ok if you want to stay at his place
2/7/17, 3:53:45 AM: JV Gortney: Appreciate it, but it's only 6 hour connection and gets in really late-- will try to stay across the street.
2/7/17, 3:54:07 AM: Wanda Yuen: ok, then I will let Lester know you don't need that
2/7/17, 3:54:22 AM: JV Gortney: Thank you :)
2/7/17, 3:55:21 AM: JV Gortney: My fav option is Lincoln/Neill's to practice blackjack at the casino
2/7/17, 4:11:41 AM: Kim Alexanderson: Don't set your hopes high for the 'casino...'
2/7/17, 4:11:56 AM: Sam Axelrod: Dude it's better than Macau!
2/7/17, 4:12:07 AM: Kim Alexanderson: And good luck - let us know that yore safely on your flight
2/7/17, 4:14:56 AM: Tim Dodwell: There are hotels opposite the airport. Easy to walk to but might be a bit pricey being so close. Or stay further away but deal with the traffic.
2/7/17, 4:15:15 AM: JV Gortney: Thanks, Kim. Will do.
2/7/17, 4:25:40 AM: Donna Gee: Massage room on 4th floor is good
2/7/17, 4:26:01 AM: Donna Gee: I do a one hour massage then they let me sleep in their chair for a 5hr layover
2/7/17, 4:26:08 AM: Sam Axelrod: Jolibees has spaghetti
2/7/17, 4:26:13 AM: Donna Gee: I've done it many times
2/7/17, 4:30:24 AM: Mike Ying: Donna gets around.
2/7/17, 4:34:08 AM: Sam Axelrod: Spaghetti?
2/7/17, 4:34:46 AM: Donna Gee: Lol
2/7/17, 5:33:28 AM: Tim Dodwell: Yum spaghetti... or just head to Maccas and sleep there
2/7/17, 6:36:37 AM: Rissa Ong: Theres apparently a transit lounge now in naia 3 http://jipang-group.com/thewings/
2/7/17, 6:36:47 AM: Rissa Ong: Havent noticed it before though

2/7/17, 7:03:10 PM: JV Gortney: Made it onto connecting flight to HK. Ended up staying in airport since delays brought us in pretty late. Came in and out of T2 so didn't make to T3 :( Most important takeaway: there is a massage service in T2, but it doesn't open until 5:30am. Thanks everyone for your help!

2/10/17, 7:53:49 AM: Catherine Munkara-Kerr: I know it's no laughing matter but it's pretty funny that they're saying "please allow more time for travel due to delays on the Tsuen Wan line" because, you know someone tried to blow the station up
2/10/17, 7:54:36 AM: Tim Orourke: Understatement of the year

2/10/17, 9:10:03 AM: Jason Cancel: Actually violence against animals is almost always a precursor to violence against people.
2/10/17, 9:16:56 AM: Shevaun Gallwey: Sorry whatsapp news faster than real news.. the rapist was re-arrested this afternoon for attacking a journalist & currently still in jail. Wrong madman!

2/22/17, 7:14:07 AM: Mike Ying: Anyone seeing these police protests in PE??
2/22/17, 7:55:50 AM: Steve Man: The police are protesting?
2/22/17, 7:57:08 AM: Donna Gee: We are two stops away
2/22/17, 8:07:16 AM: Mike Ying: Just wondering if theyre big or not because i hear theyre not allowing journos around.
2/22/17, 8:10:13 AM: JV Gortney: Boundary street is blocked off
2/22/17, 8:10:15 AM: JV Gortney: By police
2/22/17, 8:12:10 AM: Shevaun Gallwey: Apparently police rally against sentencing of the officers who beat the Occupy protestor, Ken Tsang..
2/22/17, 8:13:42 AM: Nick Tsao: Errr. So the police are protesting...?
2/22/17, 8:13:52 AM: Wanda Yuen: yes
2/22/17, 8:14:25 AM: Nick Tsao: So Should we send people up to pester them and make them violent then?
2/22/17, 8:15:18 AM: Mike Ying: Nah, I think now would be a good time to go rob a bank or a jewellery store. Anyone busy tonight? Sorry just joking big brother!
2/22/17, 8:17:45 AM: JV Gortney: Thousands of people marching. Police blocking off streets and directing crowd traffic in a giant square.

2/22/17, 8:38:51 AM: Eric Scott: So wait, the cops were upset about protestors blocking the streets so they beat up a protestor, and now they're upset about the sentencing so they're blocking the streets? Isn't that a bit of a double standard?
2/22/17, 8:39:35 AM: Mike Ying: Pretty a large portion of those in the streets have been paid to be there.
2/22/17, 8:39:40 AM: Mike Ying: *pretty sure
2/22/17, 8:41:22 AM: CAL: Glad I moved out of there

2/22/17, 8:43:14 AM: Anton Delcamp: Scmp reports a number of 30,000. Who's going to counter that figure if it's the police protesting?
2/22/17, 8:54:22 AM: Wanda Yuen: Social media. We will just say that's an alternative fact
2/22/17, 8:55:50 AM: Mike Ying: Thx Cal I needed that.

2/23/17, 12:18:37 AM: Eric Scott: Apparently the US just gave guidelines saying that any undocumented immigrants found illegally in the US should be deported to Mexico, even if they're not Mexican.
2/23/17, 12:36:02 AM: Anton Delcamp: <‚Äéimage omitted>

2/23/17, 3:47:42 AM: Steve Man: filial piety

2/27/17, 3:20:23 AM: Tim Dodwell: Are you old school rules or modern rules?
2/27/17, 3:20:30 AM: Tim Dodwell: There has to be blood!
2/27/17, 3:21:10 AM: Tim Dodwell: Body slams and maybe a few teeth missing after being slammed against the wall.
2/27/17, 3:25:01 AM: Mike Ying: "Younger Tim Dodwell learned long ago that hair pulling in squash is really painful. Hence, his current state."
2/27/17, 3:26:01 AM: Mike Ying: I'm sorry I meant, "pate". #wordnerd
2/27/17, 3:28:49 AM: Tim Dodwell: When we started playing squash, we didn't know any rules. We came out with broken teeth, cuts, bruises, blood and round ball marks all over our bodies. It was fun to smash the ball into the back of your mates head. 

But times have changed and we soon learnt the rules..... a pity
2/27/17, 3:30:17 AM: Mike Ying: "Squash" is a euphimism right? üòÇ

Two finals were taking place at the same time, making my life difficult~ I stood between the two final fields, and filmed whatever side started the point first. The women's game finished early so it's like from 5:30ish onward I filmed the open's game only

I've put the vid links on our website too: http://www.hkupa.com/hidden-a-gender/

6/20/17, 7:41:14 AM: Mike Ying: Im pretty sure it's spelt "chafvfefe"
6/20/17, 7:41:17 AM: Wanda Yuen: Yea long distance runners always use vasoline to reduce friction between socks/feet, among toes

6/20/17, 8:06:15 AM: Tuan Phan: Sometimes I think niphole shirts for runners would be a nice idea that just hasn't taken hold. You can do different designs for the holes. In unrelated news, Ossoff wins Georgia special election! means Trump's days are freaking numbered!
6/20/17, 8:08:09 AM: Tuan Phan: Wishful prediction, anyway
6/20/17, 8:15:28 AM: CAL: ???? The election is today
6/20/17, 8:17:35 AM: CAL: Fun fact - he briefly played on the same college ultimate team as me
6/20/17, 8:21:56 AM: Sam Axelrod: Trump?
6/20/17, 8:24:38 AM: Wanda Yuen: Trump doesn't exercise or work out, let alone ultimate
6/20/17, 8:38:32 AM: Tim Dodwell: We can start a support group for Tuan "Free the Nipple"
6/20/17, 8:49:19 AM: CAL: Ossoff
6/20/17, 9:03:02 AM: Wanda Yuen: üëçüèª
6/20/17, 9:07:33 AM: Nicole Alpert: Trump thinks exercise shortens life right? Ossoff, more like ossome!
6/20/17, 9:34:07 AM: Wanda Yuen: trump thinks human being has finite amount of energy. the more he works out the more he depletes
6/20/17, 12:31:17 PM: Nick Tsao: Errr. Just saw something that looks like a ferret or small fox in wong chuk hang on the street. For sure wasn't a cat. Da fuk?
6/20/17, 12:33:27 PM: Nick Tsao: Do wild foxes live in hk...?
6/20/17, 12:45:22 PM: Nick Tsao: After some research, i believe it was either an asian mongoose or indian civet.

6/20/17, 7:36:39 PM: Shevaun Gallwey: Probably a civet :)
6/20/17, 7:39:43 PM: Jak Lau: That's one weird looking doggo.
6/20/17, 7:53:02 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: warning - coffee made from the poo of a Hong Kong civet not as good as that from Indonesian civet
6/20/17, 8:02:24 PM: Wanda Yuen: fake news

6/20/17, 8:27:44 PM: Neil Gysel: I'm a freak, I got 2 uses.
6/20/17, 8:31:41 PM: Will Munkara-Kerr: One use, different applications

6/21/17, 11:35:55 AM: Tuan Phan: Stop helping Trump, Jason.
6/21/17, 11:36:39 AM: Jason Cancel: It's immigration's fault. They held up Rufina and we missed our connecting flight.
6/21/17, 11:38:01 AM: Jason Cancel: But just went shopping at target instead. If you put 2 shopping carts side by side, it's the same size as a smartcar
6/21/17, 11:38:09 AM: Wanda Yuen: That's part of Trump's scheme
6/21/17, 1:38:33 PM: Tim Orourke: First ever GGM BUWC just finished in Portugal. There were 9 teams, 6 countries and three Currier Island teams. CI 'Atlantis', CI 'no borders' and CI America. I played for CI 'no borders', we were seeded 8th. Beat Sweden in our first game then lost to team USA on day one. Day two beat Germany and U.K., then lost to second seed Austria. Day three beat another CI team then lost to CI America on universe. We finished 3rd place out of 9 after round robin play but Currier Island teams cannot advance to semis. So today played for 5th. This morning we beat Sweden then played CI America for 5th place and won on Universe. USA and Canada played in the finals. USA won 13-3.
6/21/17, 7:25:13 PM: Donna Gee: That's amazing!!!!
6/21/17, 7:25:52 PM: Donna Gee: Well done :)
6/21/17, 8:20:37 PM: Steve Man: Awesome, Tim!

6/21/17, 9:10:26 PM: Nick Tsao: why was it in portugal?
6/21/17, 9:11:29 PM: Mike Ying: Old people need more drugs.
6/21/17, 9:18:58 PM: Wanda Yuen: Sounds great Tim!
6/21/17, 9:57:15 PM: Anton Delcamp: Great experience, tim! 
How was the atmosphere? 9 teams for worlds is quite low key. It sure will grow bigger in the future. 
Did players care than it was a separate event from the "other" Worlds ?
6/21/17, 10:20:35 PM: Holly McHugh: Congrats Tim! That's a huge accomplishment!
6/22/17, 4:19:58 AM: Tim Orourke: There has never been GGM division at worlds and wasn't included at Royan, so it was organized separately by some old guys, then WFDF and BULA recognized it as part of this year's beach worlds. Would have been nice to have been played at the same spot, I think going forward they will have a GGM division at worlds
6/22/17, 4:32:14 AM: Tim Dodwell: Great work Tim, next time I will be old enough for GGM

6/22/17, 12:55:47 PM: Jason Cancel: Tim, glad you had such a great time. While it's great to see masters and up get some more traction, it's frustrating to see that it takes a lot of work by individuals to get organizers on board. Hopefully, there will be more opportunities for all in the future. 

Thanks for representing the HK community in Portugal.

7/1/17, 5:12:37 AM: Jak Lau: Dear Valued Customers,
 
We are very excited to report that Carnegie‚Äôs is in negotiations with a few groups of interested investors. To allow more time for discussions and hopefully keep the institution that Carnegie‚Äôs has become over the years alive and well we will be extending the trading for another month until the end of July. In order to keep us a healthy business we request that you, our patrons and greatest asset continue to frequent this great establishment, demonstrate how much you love us. Please continue what you do the best, dine in the restaurant, party hard, dance on the bar and generally have a good time whilst we keep working to keep the brand alive! With your continued support we are confident we can get through this and come out stronger than ever.
 
Watch this space for some great promotions over July including: live music from Jay and the Jaywalkers, top DJ tunes from DJ Jay, some good old fashioned ladies nights with a return of the topless waiters distributing jugs of cocktails the way we did in the 90s!!
 
We urge you to support us and keep the ‚Äúcarnage‚Äù in Carnegie‚Äôs!!
 
Return of the topless waiters on Wednesday 12th July. A night not to be missed as two hunky guys distribute cocktails to the girls 90s style!
7/1/17, 5:13:17 AM: Jak Lau: Linc, are we booked in to go there on Wednesday??
7/1/17, 7:18:33 AM: CAL: "Dine in the restaurant"? There's food there?

Event Date & Time: August 24, 5:00 - 6:00 pm
*Location: *Aberdeen Sport Ground (where Pan Asia used to be held)

Details: around 10 refugees will be joining the event.  It would be great if we had 3-4 volunteers join to help teach and also so we can get a game going.

They have booked the track for running afterwards at 6:45 pm, so you can stay for a track practice.

If interested please give me a message!

8/23/17, 11:58:52 PM: Lincoln Cheung: We've done one in the past, we haven't started it up again this year yet - Ying is the commissioner
8/24/17, 12:11:02 AM: Tanis Heriot: Haha! But the truth is I was sick for over a year, and still haven't been able to play Ulti, field hockey, and Bootcamp/Xfit...

I worried about losing my job - a career I spent over a decade to build. (Flying was my passion for even longer - 17 years!)
For 8 months in 2016, I didn't have my Aviation medical, which meant I couldn't fly and I didn't know if/when I would get better.
Felt like I lost part of who I was. 
It was a very challenging & humbling time for me!

I didn't date for quite a while as I was too unwell, so my personal life wasn't too exciting.

I am only just getting energy back! I miss Ulti, but I miss the people more than the game... 

During my invalid state, thought I could post some pics/words to encourage others. 

I figured: if I've been through challenges, surely other people have as well, and I wondered if I could try to spread some positivity out there.
Plus I would love to encourage other Women to pursue aviation or whatever ambitions they have. Not just Women- anyone to pursue their goals.

Felt like a Typhoon ran through my life, but the sunshine is finally coming out! ‚òÄüå¥

Miss you all! üòò
8/24/17, 12:11:52 AM: Tim Dodwell: Glad to have you back Tanisüòâ
